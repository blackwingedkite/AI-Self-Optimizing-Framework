The problem has been classified as **Indefinite Algorithm Required** because the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard, meaning no known polynomial-time algorithm can guarantee an optimal solution for all instances. Therefore, a heuristic approach is necessary.

Below is the Python code for the first version of the proposed heuristic algorithm, the **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**, executed on the given data.

### Nearest Neighbor Algorithm Implementation

The resulting score (total tour length) for the Nearest Neighbor algorithm starting from the first point is **4.5951813685530345**.

### Plan for Future Improvements

This initial Nearest Neighbor algorithm provides a quick and efficient solution, but it is a greedy heuristic and does not guarantee optimality. Here's an actionable plan for future iterations to improve the solution quality:

1.  **Multiple Starting Points:** Run the Nearest Neighbor algorithm starting from *each* of the `N` points. This will generate `N` different tours. Select the tour with the minimum total length among these `N` options. This simple modification can significantly improve the solution quality without increasing the computational complexity beyond `O(N^3)` (N runs of O(N^2)).

2.  **Local Search (e.g., 2-Opt Swap):** After obtaining an initial tour (potentially from the multiple starting points approach), apply a local search heuristic like the 2-Opt swap. This involves iteratively swapping two non-adjacent edges in the tour if doing so reduces the total tour length. This process is repeated until no further improvements can be made, helping to escape local optima and find a better solution.

3.  **Explore Other Heuristics/Metaheuristics:** If higher quality solutions are still required, investigate more sophisticated metaheuristics such as:
    *   **Simulated Annealing:** A probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function.
    *   **Genetic Algorithms:** Inspired by the process of natural selection, these algorithms can explore a large solution space effectively.
    *   **Ant Colony Optimization:** Inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, this method can find good solutions to combinatorial optimization problems.
