Task Description: 
        Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
        The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
        The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
        

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.

Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

### Reasoning

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem. This means there is no known algorithm that can find the optimal solution in polynomial time. The computational complexity of finding a guaranteed optimal solution grows exponentially with the number of points (`n`).

1.  **Brute-Force Approach**: The most straightforward method is to check every possible tour. For `n` points, the number of distinct tours is `(n-1)! / 2`. The factorial function grows extremely rapidly, making this approach infeasible for all but the smallest values of `n`.

    To illustrate, for 20 points, the number of tours to check would be:
        Checking over 60 quadrillion routes is computationally impossible in a reasonable timeframe.

2.  **Exact Algorithms**: The most efficient known exact algorithm is the Held-Karp algorithm, which uses dynamic programming. It has a time complexity of O(n² * 2ⁿ). While significantly better than the brute-force O(n!) complexity, it is still exponential. This algorithm is only practical for a small number of points (typically up to around 20-25). For larger instances, the computational requirements become prohibitive.

Because finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible for a general case, the problem requires heuristic or approximation algorithms that can find a high-quality solution in a reasonable amount of time, even if it is not guaranteed to be the absolute best.

### Proposed Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor

A simple and effective heuristic to start with is the **Nearest Neighbor algorithm**. This is a greedy algorithm that builds a tour by iteratively choosing the closest unvisited point.

#### Algorithm Description

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   Create a list of all points.
    *   Select an arbitrary starting point and add it to the `tour` list.
    *   Remove the starting point from the list of `unvisited_points`.

2.  **Tour Construction**:
    *   While there are still `unvisited_points`:
        *   Let `current_point` be the last point added to the `tour`.
        *   Find the point in `unvisited_points` that is closest to the `current_point` (using Euclidean distance). This is the `nearest_point`.
        *   Add the `nearest_point` to the `tour`.
        *   Remove the `nearest_point` from the `unvisited_points`.

3.  **Completion**:
    *   Once all points have been visited, return to the starting point to complete the cycle.

#### Advantages

*   **Fast**: The algorithm is very fast, with a time complexity of O(n²), making it suitable for a large number of points.
*   **Simple**: It is easy to understand and implement.
*   **Good Baseline**: While it does not guarantee an optimal solution, it often produces a reasonably short tour that can serve as a good starting point for more advanced optimization heuristics (like 2-opt or simulated annealing).

Now, follow these instructions:

Based on your previous analysis where you classified the problem as **Indefinite Algorithm Required**:

-   **If 'Definite Algorithm Feasible'**: Write the Python code for the exact algorithm you described. Execute it to find the optimal solution for the given data.
-   **If 'Indefinite Algorithm Required'**: Write the Python code for a first version of the heuristic algorithm you proposed. Execute the code on the given data and provide the resulting score.

After providing the code and its output, outline a brief, actionable plan for how this initial attempt could be improved in future iterations.
Please output the scores or inference results in the last line without any other values.

Based on the analysis that the problem requires an indefinite algorithm, I will implement the proposed **Nearest Neighbor heuristic**.

This initial version starts the tour from the first point in the provided list. It then iteratively builds the tour by selecting the closest unvisited point until all points have been added. Finally, it calculates the total length of the tour, including the return to the starting point.

### Plan for Improvement

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm provides a fast but often suboptimal solution. The initial tour's quality is highly dependent on the starting point. Here is an actionable plan to improve upon this first version:

1.  **Multi-Start Nearest Neighbor:** The most straightforward improvement is to run the current Nearest Neighbor algorithm `n` times, once for each point as a starting point. After running all `n` iterations, the shortest of the `n` generated tours would be selected. This mitigates the risk of a poor tour due to an unlucky starting point.

2.  **Implement a Tour Improvement Heuristic (2-Opt):** After generating an initial tour (e.g., from the best result of the Multi-Start NN), apply a local search algorithm like **2-Opt**. The 2-Opt algorithm works by iteratively swapping pairs of edges in the current tour to see if a shorter tour can be made. For example, if we have a tour `...A-B...C-D...`, 2-Opt would test replacing the edges `(A,B)` and `(C,D)` with `(A,C)` and `(B,D)`. This process is repeated until no more improvements can be found, refining the initial solution to a local optimum.

3.  **Explore Advanced Metaheuristics:** For further improvement and to escape local optima (where 2-Opt might get stuck), more advanced algorithms could be implemented. A good next step would be **Simulated Annealing**, which uses a probabilistic approach (based on a "temperature" parameter) to sometimes accept worse moves, allowing it to explore more of the solution space and find a better overall solution.
