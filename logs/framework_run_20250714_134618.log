Task Description: 
            Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
            The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
            The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
            

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.

Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

### Reasoning

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. This classification is based on its computational complexity.

1.  **Combinatorial Explosion**: The number of possible tours for `N` points is `(N-1)! / 2`. The factorial function grows extremely rapidly. For example, for just 20 points, there are over 1.2 x 10¹⁸ possible tours. A brute-force approach that evaluates every single tour is computationally infeasible for all but the smallest number of points.

2.  **Lack of a Polynomial-Time Exact Algorithm**: Despite extensive research, no algorithm has been found that can solve the TSP to optimality in polynomial time (i.e., with a complexity of O(N^k) for some constant k). The most efficient known exact algorithm is the Held-Karp algorithm, which uses dynamic programming. Its time complexity is O(N² * 2^N). While much better than the factorial complexity of brute-force, this exponential growth still renders it impractical for larger instances (typically becoming infeasible for N > 25-30).

Because finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally intractable for a general number of points, the problem requires the use of heuristic or approximation algorithms. These algorithms aim to find a high-quality solution in a reasonable amount of time, but they do not guarantee optimality.

### Proposed Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor

A simple and intuitive heuristic to start with is the **Nearest Neighbor algorithm**. It is a greedy algorithm that builds a tour by iteratively choosing the closest unvisited point.

#### Algorithm Description:

1.  **Initialization**: Start at an arbitrary point (e.g., the first point in the list). This will be the starting and ending point of the tour.
2.  **Iteration**: From the current point, find the nearest unvisited point using the Euclidean distance.
3.  **Move**: Travel to this nearest point and add it to the tour. Mark it as visited.
4.  **Termination**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all points have been visited.
5.  **Complete the Tour**: Return to the starting point from the last visited point.

#### Example Walkthrough:

Let's say we have points A, B, C, D.
1.  Start at A. Tour: [A]
2.  Assume C is the closest unvisited point to A. Tour: [A, C]
3.  From C, assume B is the closest unvisited point. Tour: [A, C, B]
4.  From B, the only unvisited point is D. Tour: [A, C, B, D]
5.  All points are visited. Return to the start. Final Tour: A -> C -> B -> D -> A.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages:

*   **Advantage**: It is very fast, with a time complexity of O(N²), and simple to implement.
*   **Disadvantage**: Being a greedy algorithm, it often leads to suboptimal solutions. The initial choices can force suboptimal connections later in the tour, which cannot be undone. The choice of the starting point can also significantly affect the quality of the final tour.

While the Nearest Neighbor algorithm provides a quick and straightforward solution, more advanced heuristics like **2-Opt**, **Simulated Annealing**, or **Genetic Algorithms** are generally required to find solutions that are closer to the optimal tour length.

Based on the previous analysis classifying the problem as **Indefinite Algorithm Required**, here is the Python implementation of the proposed **Nearest Neighbor** heuristic algorithm.

### Plan for Future Improvement

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm provides a fast but often suboptimal solution. The initial tour length of **4.89** can be improved by addressing the greedy nature of the algorithm. Here is an actionable plan for the next iteration:

1.  **Implement a Multi-Start Nearest Neighbor:** The current algorithm's output depends heavily on the starting point (point 0). A simple improvement is to run the Nearest Neighbor algorithm `N` times, each time starting from a different point (`0` to `N-1`). The shortest tour among these `N` results would then be selected. This mitigates the risk of a poor initial choice locking the tour into a highly suboptimal path.

2.  **Implement a Tour Improvement Heuristic (2-Opt):** A more powerful enhancement is to take the initial tour generated by the Nearest Neighbor algorithm and refine it using an improvement heuristic like **2-Opt**. The 2-Opt algorithm works by repeatedly swapping pairs of non-adjacent edges in the tour if doing so reduces the total tour length. For example, if we have a tour segment `...A-B...C-D...`, 2-Opt would test if replacing the edges `(A,B)` and `(C,D)` with `(A,C)` and `(B,D)` creates a shorter path. This process is repeated until no more length-reducing swaps can be found, effectively removing path crossings and improving upon the initial greedy solution.

Here is my plan for this iteration.

**1. Analyze and Strategize**

*   **Previous Strategy Analysis**: The last attempt utilized a **Nearest Neighbor** heuristic. This is a greedy algorithm that, while fast, can often lead to suboptimal solutions by making locally optimal choices that result in poor overall paths. The score of 4.890763892785763 is a good baseline but can likely be improved.
*   **New Strategy Proposal**: I will implement the **2-Opt** heuristic, a local search algorithm designed to improve an existing tour. The 2-Opt algorithm works by iteratively swapping pairs of non-adjacent edges in the tour to see if a shorter path can be created. This process is repeated until no more improvements can be found.
*   **Justification**: The 2-Opt algorithm is a classic and effective method for refining TSP solutions. It directly addresses a key weakness of greedy algorithms like Nearest Neighbor by "uncrossing" paths, which is a common source of inefficiency. I will use the tour generated by the Nearest Neighbor algorithm as the starting point for the 2-Opt optimization. This combination of a constructive heuristic followed by an improvement heuristic is a powerful and common approach for TSP.

**2. Implement and Execute**

Here is the Python code implementing the 2-Opt strategy, starting with an initial tour from the Nearest Neighbor algorithm.

**3. Report and Compare**

*   **New Result**: 4.35377714043668
*   **Comparison**: The new score of **4.35377714043668** is a significant improvement over the previous best score of **4.890763892785763**. The 2-Opt optimization successfully refined the initial Nearest Neighbor tour into a much shorter path.
