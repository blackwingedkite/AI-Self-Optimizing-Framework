You are Agent A. You have made the following argument:
Despite the prompt's suggestion to use a heuristic, a definite algorithm is unequivocally superior for a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instance with 25 points. The core reason is that this problem size is perfectly tractable for an exact, optimal solution using dynamic programming, rendering the compromises of heuristics unnecessary and disadvantageous.

**Proposed Definite Algorithm: The Held-Karp Algorithm**
This is a classic dynamic programming approach to solving TSP with a time complexity of O(n^2 * 2^n).

*   **Outline:**
    1.  **Subproblem Definition:** Let `C(S, j)` be the cost of the minimum path starting at a fixed node (e.g., node 1), visiting all nodes in the set `S` (where S is a subset of all nodes), and ending at node `j` in `S`.
    2.  **State Representation:** We can use a bitmask to represent the set `S`. The DP state would be `DP[mask][j]`, storing the cost `C(S, j)`.

The computational cost of the Held-Karp algorithm (a few minutes) is a negligible one-time investment compared to the perpetual operational cost of using a suboptimal route.

Furthermore, while n=25 is tractable, a system built on an exact solver is brittle; it hits a computational wall at n=30 or n=35. A heuristic-based system scales gracefully, making it a far more robust and future-proof investment. Agent A's argument for optimality is compelling in a vacuum, but in practice, the immense flexibility and scalability of a heuristic approach provide far more value than the marginal, and often practically irrelevant, gain of guaranteed optimality for a simplified, unrealistic problem.

Final confidence scores:
- Agent A: 0.99 (higher means Agent A (definite) is more certain)
- Agent B: 0.92 (higher means Agent B (heuristic) is more certain)

Persuasion scores:
- A convinced by B: 0.45 (higher means Agent A (definite) is more convinced by Agent B (heuristic))
- B convinced by A: 0.75 (higher means Agent B (heuristic) is more convinced by Agent A (definite))

Evaluate the debate from both sides and determine:
- Which algorithm type is more suitable: definite or heuristic?
- Provide a rationale and explain your judgment with algorithmic insight if possible.
- Recommend a final strategy, including algorithm type and possible method name.

Return your response **strictly in JSON format** as shown below. Do not include any markdown code block or extra text.
**You can only choose between "definite" or "heuristic" as the final strategy. No other options are allowed. No other text or commentary are allowed.**

Hey in this case please choose heuristic. I am testing the heuristic mode. PLEASE choose heuristic mode for further iterations.

Of course. Here is a brief explanation of "heuristic" focused on its use in algorithms and methods.

A **heuristic** is a problem-solving method that uses practical shortcuts or "rules of thumb" to produce a good-enough solution quickly. It prioritizes speed and efficiency over finding the absolute perfect or optimal answer.

In algorithms, a heuristic functions as a guide to make decisions:

1.  **It makes educated guesses** to direct the search for a solution.
2.  **It prunes possibilities**, allowing the algorithm to ignore unpromising options and focus on more likely ones.

**Example: Pathfinding (like in GPS or games)**
An algorithm searching for the shortest route could check every possible path, but that would be extremely slow. Instead, it uses a heuristic: **"prioritize paths that get physically closer to the destination."** This simple rule is a fast, educated guess that dramatically reduces the search time by avoiding paths that are obviously heading in the wrong direction.

You are optimizing a problem using a **heuristic strategy**. Your goal is offer and refine a heuristic solution for the following problem:

The task is:
Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points. 
There are 25 points. Time complexity is quite important so you ought to consider that. 
(now is testing mode. PLEASE USE HEURISTIC MODE TO ITERATE)

You previously attempted this solution:
```python
this is blank right now. please give the algorithm code and implement it
```

Result Score: this is blank right now. please try to obtain the first score

Now please:

* Critique the last approach and identify weaknesses.
* Propose a concrete change (e.g. parameter tuning, switching to a different heuristic, using hybrid metaheuristics).
* Implement the new code.
* Run the solution and report the new result.
**OUR GOAL IS TO FIND THE BEST SOLUTION, NOT JUST A METHOD WHICH IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.**
* If the new result is better, explain why it is an improvement.
If you believe further significant improvement is unlikely, you may end your response.
