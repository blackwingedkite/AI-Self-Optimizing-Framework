Task Description: 
    Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
    The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
    The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
    

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.

Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

### Reasoning

**1. Computational Complexity Analysis:**

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem. The objective is to find the shortest tour that visits every point in a given set. The number of possible distinct tours for *n* points is `(n-1)! / 2`.

To understand why this is computationally infeasible, let's calculate the number of possible tours for a small number of points:

As the output demonstrates, the number of potential solutions grows factorially. A brute-force approach that checks every possible tour becomes impossible for even a moderate number of points. For instance, if a computer could check one billion tours per second, it would still take over 1,900 years to find the optimal solution for just 20 points.

Because there is no known algorithm that can find the guaranteed optimal solution in polynomial time, the problem is classified as NP-hard. This necessitates the use of heuristic or approximation algorithms that can find a good, but not necessarily perfect, solution in a reasonable amount of time.

### Proposed Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor

A good starting point for solving the TSP is the **Nearest Neighbor** algorithm. It is a greedy algorithm, meaning it makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.

#### Algorithm Description:

1.  **Initialization**: Start at an arbitrary point (e.g., the first point in the list). This point becomes the current point and the beginning of the tour.
2.  **Iteration**:
    *   Find the unvisited point that is closest to the current point using the Euclidean distance.
    *   Add this point to the tour.
    *   Mark it as visited and set it as the new current point.
3.  **Repetition**: Repeat step 2 until all points have been visited.
4.  **Completion**: To complete the tour, return from the last visited point to the starting point.

#### Why it's a Heuristic:

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is fast and simple to implement. However, its greedy nature is also its primary weakness. Early choices may lead to situations later where the only available points are very far away, resulting in a suboptimal tour. It provides a quick, reasonable approximation but offers no guarantee of finding the shortest possible path.

Here is the data to use:
points = [[0.37827407, 0.81960009], [0.40554122, 0.70205353], [0.22801359, 0.50694331], [0.06170324, 0.49000263], [0.84574653, 0.30008245], [0.21478677, 0.19239269], [0.26434356, 0.5662044 ], [0.23679042, 0.80090686], [0.13807644, 0.21306198], [0.24531236, 0.56240853], [0.71463785, 0.42577315], [0.12105954, 0.51605277], [0.81020896, 0.4511901 ], [0.3843108 , 0.56079801], [0.65084264, 0.10295982], [0.65605101, 0.34134963], [0.24385386, 0.25861321], [0.39859698, 0.53913291], [0.18114901, 0.73188622], [0.61347351, 0.84101434]]

Now, follow these instructions:

Based on your previous analysis where you classified the problem as **Indefinite Algorithm Required**:

-   **If 'Definite Algorithm Feasible'**: Write the Python code for the exact algorithm you described. Execute it to find the optimal solution for the given data.
-   **If 'Indefinite Algorithm Required'**: Write the Python code for a first version of the heuristic algorithm you proposed. Execute the code on the given data and provide the resulting score.

After providing the code and its output, outline a brief, actionable plan for how this initial attempt could be improved in future iterations.

My previous analysis classified this problem as **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**. Therefore, I will implement the proposed **Nearest Neighbor** heuristic algorithm.

### Nearest Neighbor Algorithm Implementation

Here is the Python code for the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. It calculates a tour for the given set of points and returns the total distance, which serves as the score for the solution.

### Plan for Future Improvement

The initial Nearest Neighbor algorithm provides a fast but potentially suboptimal solution. Here is a brief, actionable plan to improve upon this first attempt:

1.  **Multi-Start Nearest Neighbor**: The quality of the Nearest Neighbor tour is highly dependent on the starting point.
    *   **Action**: Run the Nearest Neighbor algorithm *N* times, where *N* is the number of points. In each run, use a different point as the starting node.
    *   **Goal**: Select the best (shortest) tour from the *N* generated tours. This mitigates the risk of an unlucky starting choice leading to a poor overall path.

2.  **Implement a 2-Opt Heuristic**: After generating an initial tour (e.g., with the multi-start Nearest Neighbor), refine it using a local search algorithm like 2-Opt.
    *   **Action**: Systematically check every pair of non-adjacent edges in the tour. If swapping these two edges (i.e., reversing the path segment between them) results in a shorter tour, make the swap. Repeat this process until no more improvements can be found.
    *   **Goal**: This will "uncross" paths in the tour, significantly improving upon the greedy choices made by the initial algorithm and moving the solution closer to the global optimum.

3.  **Explore More Advanced Heuristics**: If further improvement is needed, implement a more sophisticated metaheuristic.
    *   **Action**: Implement an algorithm like **Simulated Annealing**. This approach is similar to 2-Opt but includes a mechanism to occasionally accept "worse" moves, allowing it to escape local optima that might trap a simpler algorithm like 2-Opt.
    *   **Goal**: To find a high-quality solution that is very close to the optimal one, trading a small increase in computation time for a potentially large improvement in the final score.
