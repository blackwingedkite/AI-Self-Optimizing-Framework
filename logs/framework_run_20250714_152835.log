Task Description: 
            Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
            The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
            The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
            

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.

Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

**Reasoning:**

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known problem in combinatorial optimization. Its objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits each given point exactly once and returns to the starting point. The distance between points is defined as the Euclidean distance.

The TSP is classified as NP-hard. This means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm that can guarantee finding the optimal solution for all instances. While exact algorithms exist (e.g., brute-force search, dynamic programming using Held-Karp algorithm), their computational complexity grows exponentially with the number of points.

*   **Brute-force approach:** This involves checking every possible permutation of visiting the points. For `n` points, there are `(n-1)!` possible tours (if starting point is fixed). This grows extremely rapidly (e.g., 10 points = 362,880 tours; 20 points = 2.4 x 10^17 tours).
*   **Held-Karp Algorithm (Dynamic Programming):** This is one of the fastest exact algorithms, with a time complexity of O(n^2 * 2^n). While significantly better than brute-force, it is still exponential and becomes computationally infeasible for even moderately large numbers of points (e.g., typically impractical for n > 20-25).

Given this inherent computational complexity, finding a guaranteed optimal solution for large instances within a reasonable time frame is not feasible. Therefore, the problem falls into the "Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)" category, necessitating the use of heuristic or approximation algorithms.

**Proposed Effective Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**

The Nearest Neighbor Algorithm is a simple and fast greedy heuristic for the TSP. While it does not guarantee an optimal solution, it often provides a reasonably good tour in polynomial time.

**Steps:**

1.  **Start Point Selection:** Choose an arbitrary starting point (or the specified origin point).
2.  **Iterative Selection:** From the current point, identify the unvisited point that is closest (has the minimum Euclidean distance) to it.
3.  **Move:** Travel to that closest unvisited point.
4.  **Repeat:** Continue steps 2 and 3 until all points have been visited.
5.  **Return to Origin:** From the last visited point, travel back to the initial starting point to complete the tour.

**Example Walkthrough:**

Let's say we have points A, B, C, D, and we start at A.
*   Current point: A. Unvisited: B, C, D.
*   Find the closest to A among B, C, D. Let's say C is closest.
*   Move to C. Current point: C. Unvisited: B, D.
*   Find the closest to C among B, D. Let's say B is closest.
*   Move to B. Current point: B. Unvisited: D.
*   Find the closest to B among D. D is the only option.
*   Move to D. Current point: D. All points visited.
*   Return to A from D.

The resulting tour would be A -> C -> B -> D -> A.

**Advantages:**

*   **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and implement.
*   **Speed:** Has a polynomial time complexity, typically O(n^2) for `n` points, making it very fast even for a large number of points.

**Limitations:**

*   **Sub-optimality:** Being a greedy algorithm, it can get stuck in local optima and may not find the shortest possible tour. The quality of the solution can depend heavily on the choice of the starting point. To mitigate this, the algorithm can be run multiple times, starting from each possible point, and the best tour found can be selected.

**Resulting Score:** 4.8471317101618325

**Plan for Future Improvements:**

1.  **Multiple Starting Points:** The Nearest Neighbor algorithm's performance is highly dependent on the initial starting point. A significant improvement would be to run the algorithm `n` times, once for each possible starting point, and then select the tour with the minimum total distance among all runs. This is often called the "Greedy Nearest Neighbor" or "Multi-start Nearest Neighbor" approach.
2.  **Local Search Heuristics (e.g., 2-Opt):** After obtaining an initial tour from the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, apply a local search heuristic like the 2-Opt algorithm. 2-Opt works by iteratively swapping two non-adjacent edges in the tour if doing so reduces the total tour length. This can significantly improve the quality of the solution by escaping local optima found by the greedy Nearest Neighbor approach.
3.  **Visualization:** Implement a visualization tool (e.g., using Matplotlib) to plot the points and the resulting tour. This would help in visually assessing the quality of the tour and identifying potential areas for improvement.

**1. Analyze and Strategize:**

My previous attempt (Iteration 2) utilized the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, achieving a score of 4.8471317101618325. While Nearest Neighbor is a good greedy heuristic for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), it often produces sub-optimal solutions. To improve upon this, I will employ a local search optimization technique: the 2-Opt algorithm.

**New Strategy: Apply 2-Opt Local Search after Nearest Neighbor.**
The 2-Opt algorithm works by iteratively improving an existing tour by reversing segments of the tour if doing so reduces the total tour length. It effectively eliminates "crossings" in the tour, leading to a shorter path. By combining the Nearest Neighbor algorithm (for an initial tour) with 2-Opt (for refinement), we aim to find a significantly better solution.

**Justification:**
Nearest Neighbor is a constructive heuristic, building a path step-by-step. 2-Opt is an improvement heuristic, taking an existing path and refining it. This combination is a standard and effective approach in solving TSP-like problems, as the local optimization of 2-Opt can correct the greedy choices made by Nearest Neighbor, leading to a shorter overall path.

**2. Implement and Execute:**

I will first implement the `calculate_distance` and `calculate_total_distance` functions. Then, I will implement the Nearest Neighbor algorithm to generate an initial tour. Finally, I will implement the 2-Opt algorithm and apply it to the tour obtained from Nearest Neighbor.

**3. Report and Compare:**

The new result after applying the 2-Opt optimization to the Nearest Neighbor tour is **4.197799554272438**.

Comparing this to the best result from all previous attempts (4.8471317101618325), the 2-Opt algorithm has successfully reduced the total tour length, indicating a significant improvement.
