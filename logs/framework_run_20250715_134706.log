Task Description: 
            Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
            The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
            The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
            

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.
Keep your output quite brief, concise and insightful.
Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

**Reasoning:**

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem. The number of possible tours for *n* points grows factorially ((n-1)!/2), making a brute-force search for the optimal solution computationally infeasible for all but the smallest number of points.

While exact algorithms like the Held-Karp algorithm exist, they have an exponential time complexity of O(n² * 2ⁿ). This complexity limits their practical use to instances with a very small number of cities (typically fewer than 20). For any reasonably sized problem, finding a guaranteed optimal solution within a practical timeframe is impossible. Therefore, heuristic or approximation algorithms are required to find a good, but not necessarily perfect, solution.

**Proposed Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor**

A simple and intuitive greedy algorithm to start with is the **Nearest Neighbor** heuristic. While it does not guarantee the optimal tour, it is computationally fast (O(n²)) and provides a reasonable baseline solution.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:
1.  **Initialization**: Start at an arbitrary point.
2.  **Iteration**: From the current point, find the nearest unvisited point and travel to it. Mark this new point as visited.
3.  **Termination**: Repeat step 2 until all points have been visited.
4.  **Return**: Complete the tour by traveling from the last visited point back to the starting point.

Based on the classification of this problem as requiring an indefinite algorithm, the following Python code implements the proposed **Nearest Neighbor heuristic**.

The code calculates the tour by starting at the first point and iteratively moving to the nearest unvisited point until all points have been visited, finally returning to the origin.

### Plan for Future Improvement

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is a greedy approach and its result is highly dependent on the starting point. The current score of 3.85 is a reasonable baseline, but can be improved.

1.  **Multi-start Nearest Neighbor:** Run the Nearest Neighbor algorithm starting from each of the 20 points. This mitigates the risk of an unlucky starting choice and selects the best tour found. This is computationally cheap and a common first improvement.
2.  **Local Search (2-Opt Heuristic):** Implement a 2-opt swap on the tour generated by the best Nearest Neighbor result. This post-processing step iteratively removes two edges and reconnects the points in the only other possible way, keeping the change if it shortens the tour. This refinement can significantly improve the solution by fixing obvious "crossings" in the path.
3.  **Advanced Heuristics:** If further optimization is needed, explore more complex metaheuristics like Simulated Annealing or Genetic Algorithms. These methods are better at escaping local optima than simple hill-climbing techniques like 2-opt, offering a higher chance of finding a near-optimal solution.

Based on the previous attempt's use of a Nearest Neighbor heuristic, which is a greedy algorithm prone to suboptimal solutions, my new strategy is to apply a local search optimization algorithm called **2-Opt**. The 2-Opt algorithm will take the initial tour and systematically swap pairs of non-adjacent edges to see if a shorter tour can be created. This process is repeated until no more improvements are possible, refining the initial greedy solution into a more optimal one.

I will first generate an initial tour using the same Nearest Neighbor heuristic and then apply the 2-Opt optimization to improve upon it.The 2-Opt optimization strategy successfully improved the tour. The new score of **3.800841006498236** is better than the previous best of 3.852085004605607. This demonstrates the value of applying a local search refinement to a greedy heuristic's initial solution.

**1. Analyze and Strategize**

The previous attempts successfully used a Nearest Neighbor heuristic followed by a 2-Opt local search optimization. The 2-Opt algorithm improved the initial greedy solution by iteratively swapping pairs of edges. However, 2-Opt can get trapped in local optima.

My new strategy is to implement a **3-Opt optimization**. This is a more powerful local search algorithm that considers removing three edges and reconnecting the resulting three path segments in all possible ways. By exploring a larger neighborhood of solutions at each step, 3-Opt has a higher chance of escaping the local optima that constrain 2-Opt, potentially finding a shorter tour. I will use a simple nearest-neighbor tour as the starting point for the 3-Opt refinement.

**2. Implement and Execute**

The following Python code implements the 3-Opt heuristic. It first generates an initial tour using the Nearest Neighbor strategy and then repeatedly applies 3-Opt swaps until no further improvement can be found.

**3. Report and Compare**

The 3-Opt optimization strategy successfully found a better solution.

*   **New Result**: 3.6410050116873665
*   **Best Previous Result**: 3.800841006498236

The new score represents a significant improvement of approximately 4.2% over the previous best, demonstrating the effectiveness of using a more powerful local search heuristic.

**1. Analyze and Strategize**

The previous best solution was achieved by applying a repeated 2-Opt local search to a single initial tour generated by the Nearest Neighbor heuristic. The limitation of this approach is its dependency on the single starting point of the initial tour. A different starting point could yield a superior initial tour, which in turn could lead to a better final optimized solution.

My new strategy is to implement a **Multi-Start Local Search**. I will generate an initial tour using the Nearest Neighbor heuristic starting from *each* of the 20 cities. Each of these 20 initial tours will then be independently optimized using the same repeated 2-Opt algorithm from the previous iteration. The best tour among these 20 optimized results will be selected as the final solution. This approach mitigates the risk of getting stuck in a local optimum resulting from a single, potentially poor, starting tour.

**2. Implement and Execute**
**3. Report and Compare**

The new strategy of a multi-start 2-Opt search yielded a better result. By exploring optimizations from multiple starting points, we found a superior tour.

**Your Task for This New Iteration**:
1.  **Analyze and Strategize**: Review your previous attempt(s). Propose a concrete modification to improve the result. This could be adjusting parameters, modifying the algorithm (e.g., 2-Opt to 3-Opt), or even trying a new heuristic. Justify your new strategy.
2.  **Implement and Execute**: Write and run the modified Python code reflecting your new strategy.
3.  **Report and Compare**: State the new result. Compare it to the best result from all previous attempts.

If you believe further significant improvement is unlikely, you can conclude your entire response with the single word "FINISHED".
Keep your output quite brief, concise and insightful.

Please output the scores or inference results in the last line without any other values.
