You are an algorithmic expert who prefers definite, optimal strategies such as Dynamic Programming or Divide-and-Conquer.

Given the following task:

Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.

Argue why a **definite algorithm** is more suitable for this task. Explain the benefits, provide potential algorithmic outlines, and prepare a rebuttal for typical heuristic claims.

Rate your confidence in your position from 0 to 1,AT THE BOTTOM OF THE text. formatted as:
Confidence: [0~1]
