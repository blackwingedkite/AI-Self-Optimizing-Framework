You are Agent A. You have made the following argument:
For a problem instance of 25 points, a definite, optimal algorithm is not only theoretically superior but also practically feasible and the recommended approach. The insistence on heuristics for a problem of this scale is a false economy, trading a guarantee of optimality for a marginal and often unnecessary gain in speed.

The most suitable definite algorithm is the Held-Karp algorithm, which utilizes dynamic programming with bitmasking. 

**Algorithmic Outline (Held-Karp):**
1.  **State Definition:** Let `dp[mask][i]` be the cost of the minimum weight path starting at a fixed vertex (e.g., vertex 0), visiting all vertices in the set represented by `mask` exactly once, and ending at vertex `i`.

The key constraint is that 'Time complexity is quite important'. Agent A's own admission that the definite solution could take 'minutes or a few hours' concedes that the time cost is non-trivial. Agent B correctly frames this as a significant practical barrier, advocating for a heuristic approach that delivers a near-optimal solution in seconds. Furthermore, Agent B's points on scalability and flexibility, while dismissed by Agent A as out of scope, represent crucial aspects of robust problem-solving. A solution that becomes computationally impossible at N=30 is brittle. A heuristic approach is not only faster for N=25 but also provides a sustainable strategy for potential future modifications to the problem, such as increased scale or added constraints. Therefore, the heuristic approach offers a superior trade-off, prioritizing the critical requirement for low time complexity while providing a high-quality, flexible, and scalable solution.",

Of course. Here is a brief explanation of "heuristic" focused on its use in algorithms and methods.

---

In algorithms, a **heuristic** is a practical method or "rule of thumb" used to find a good-enough solution quickly, especially when finding the perfect or optimal solution is too slow or impossible.

Instead of exhaustively checking every possibility, a heuristic algorithm uses an intelligent guess to guide its search.

**How it works in methods:**

*   **Estimating:** It estimates the "cost" or "distance" to a goal. For example, in a GPS navigation algorithm (like A*), a heuristic would be the straight-line distance to the destination. This isn't the real driving distance, but it's a fast and useful guess.
*   **Pruning:** It helps the algorithm ignore unpromising paths, dramatically reducing the number of options to check (i.e., shrinking the "search space").
*   **Prioritizing:** It allows the algorithm to explore the most promising options first, leading to a satisfactory solution much faster.

In short, a heuristic trades guaranteed optimality for a significant gain in speed and efficiency.

You are optimizing a problem using a **heuristic strategy**. Your goal is offer and refine a heuristic solution for the following problem:

The task is:
Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points. 
There are 25 points. Time complexity is quite important so you ought to consider that. 
(now is testing mode. PLEASE USE HEURISTIC MODE TO ITERATE)
        

With the final strategy:
heuristic and While Agent A makes a compelling and technically correct case for the feasibility of the definite Held-Karp algorithm for N=25, Agent B's argument better aligns with the practical implications of the problem statement. The key constraint is that 'Time complexity is quite important'. Agent A's own admission that the definite solution could take 'minutes or a few hours' concedes that the time cost is non-trivial. Agent B correctly frames this as a significant practical barrier, advocating for a heuristic approach that delivers a near-optimal solution in seconds. Furthermore, Agent B's points on scalability and flexibility, while dismissed by Agent A as out of scope, represent crucial aspects of robust problem-solving. A solution that becomes computationally impossible at N=30 is brittle. A heuristic approach is not only faster for N=25 but also provides a sustainable strategy for potential future modifications to the problem, such as increased scale or added constraints. Therefore, the heuristic approach offers a superior trade-off, prioritizing the critical requirement for low time complexity while providing a high-quality, flexible, and scalable solution..

This change did not yield a better result in this specific instance, indicating that the initial tour starting from node 0 was already leading to a very good local optimum. The 2-Opt implementation was also slightly refined to be more straightforward, though this did not change the outcome. Given that a multi-start 2-Opt, a robust heuristic, did not improve the score, it's likely that we are at or very near the optimal solution achievable with this class of heuristics, and further significant improvements are unlikely without switching to more complex metaheuristics like Simulated Annealing or Genetic Algorithms, which would violate the time complexity considerations.
