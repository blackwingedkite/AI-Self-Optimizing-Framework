Task Description: 
            Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
            The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
            The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
            

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.
Keep your output quite brief, concise and insightful.
Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

**Reasoning:**
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem. The number of possible tours for `n` points is `(n-1)! / 2`. This factorial growth means that a brute-force approach, which checks every possible tour to find the optimal one, becomes computationally infeasible even for a small number of points (e.g., >20). Since no known algorithm can find the guaranteed optimal solution in polynomial time, heuristic or approximation methods are required for practical applications.

**Proposed Heuristic Algorithm (Nearest Neighbor):**
A simple and effective heuristic to start with is the **Nearest Neighbor algorithm**. It is a greedy approach that works as follows:

1.  **Initialization:** Start at an arbitrary point.
2.  **Iteration:** From the current point, find the nearest unvisited point and move to it.
3.  **Termination:** Repeat step 2 until all points have been visited. Finally, return to the starting point to complete the tour.

While this algorithm is fast and easy to implement, it does not guarantee the optimal solution but often provides a reasonably short tour.

Here is the data to use:

Here is the implementation of the Nearest Neighbor heuristic for the Traveling Salesman Problem, along with the resulting tour length for the provided data.

My apologies, a bug was present in the initial code. The corrected code fixes the error in calculating the distance back to the starting point.

Here is the corrected implementation of the Nearest Neighbor heuristic and its result.

### Plan for Improvement

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm provides a fast but often suboptimal solution. Its greedy nature can lead to poor choices that create very long final edges. Here is a brief plan to improve this initial result:

1.  **Multi-start Nearest Neighbor:** The current result depends entirely on the arbitrary starting point (the first point in the list). A simple improvement is to run the Nearest Neighbor algorithm for every point as a starting point and select the shortest tour found. This mitigates the risk of an unlucky starting choice without a significant increase in complexity.

2.  **Implement a Tour Improvement Heuristic (2-Opt):** After generating an initial tour with the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, apply a local search algorithm like **2-opt**. The 2-opt heuristic works by iteratively swapping pairs of non-adjacent edges in the tour to see if a shorter path can be formed. This process is repeated until no more improvements can be found, effectively untangling any crossed paths and refining the initial greedy solution.

3.  **Explore Metaheuristics:** For more complex problems or higher-quality solutions, advance to metaheuristics like **Simulated Annealing**. This method builds on 2-opt by occasionally accepting worse solutions to escape local optima, thereby exploring a wider portion of the solution space to find a globally better tour.

**1. Analyze and Strategize**

The previous best score was achieved using the Nearest Neighbor heuristic. This is a greedy algorithm that often produces reasonably good but suboptimal solutions. A standard and effective method to improve upon such a solution is to apply a local search optimization algorithm.

My strategy is to use the **2-Opt heuristic**. I will first generate an initial tour using the same Nearest Neighbor algorithm and then iteratively refine this tour using 2-Opt. The 2-Opt algorithm works by systematically swapping pairs of non-adjacent edges in the tour to see if a shorter path can be found. This process is repeated until no more improvements are possible, resulting in a "2-optimal" tour which is very likely to be shorter than the initial greedy solution.

**2. Implement and Execute**

The following Python code implements the Nearest Neighbor heuristic to create an initial tour, and then applies the 2-Opt algorithm to optimize it.

**3. Report and Compare**

The 2-Opt optimization strategy successfully improved upon the previous result.

*   **Previous Best (Nearest Neighbor)**: 4.040241720461873
*   **New Result (NN + 2-Opt)**: 3.94284911232349

The new score is approximately 2.4% better than the best score from the previous iteration.

**1. Analyze and Strategize**

The previous best result was achieved by applying a 2-Opt local search optimization to an initial tour generated by the Nearest Neighbor heuristic. The quality of the final tour produced by 2-Opt can be dependent on the quality of the starting tour. The previous attempt used only one starting tour (generated from node 0).

My strategy for this iteration is to implement a multi-start heuristic. I will generate an initial tour using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm starting from *every* node in the dataset. Then, I will apply the 2-Opt optimization to each of these 20 initial tours and select the best overall result. This approach more thoroughly explores the solution space and reduces the dependency on a single, potentially suboptimal, starting tour.

**2. Implement and Execute**
**3. Report and Compare**

The new strategy of applying 2-Opt to multiple initial tours (one starting from each node) yielded a better result. The previous best score was 3.94284911232349, and the new score is an improvement.

**1. Analyze and Strategize**

The previous best result was achieved by applying a 2-Opt local search to an initial tour from the Nearest Neighbor heuristic. The quality of this initial tour is highly dependent on the starting city. A different starting city can produce a completely different tour, which, when optimized with 2-Opt, might fall into a better local optimum.

My new strategy is to run the entire Nearest Neighbor + 2-Opt process for every possible starting city. I will generate N tours (where N is the number of cities), optimize each one with 2-Opt, and then select the best overall result. This multi-start approach systematically explores different regions of the solution space, increasing the probability of finding a superior solution.

The new strategy of applying a multi-start 2-Opt, by iterating through all possible starting cities for the initial Nearest Neighbor tour, has yielded a better result.

-   **New Score**: 3.8154515077202653

This represents a notable improvement, confirming that the choice of the initial tour significantly impacts the final optimized solution.

2.  **Implement and Execute**: Write and run the modified Python code reflecting your new strategy.
3.  **Report and Compare**: State the new result. Compare it to the best result from all previous attempts.

If you believe further significant improvement is unlikely, you can conclude your entire response with the single word "FINISHED".
Keep your output quite brief, concise and insightful.

Please output the scores or inference results in the last line without any other values.


Remember to use the same initial data:

**1. Analyze and Strategize**

The previous best score was achieved by applying a 2-Opt local search to initial tours generated by the Nearest Neighbor heuristic, starting from every possible node. While this multi-start approach diversifies the search, the underlying greedy nature of the Nearest Neighbor heuristic can still lead to suboptimal initial tours.

My new strategy is to replace the Nearest Neighbor heuristic with a more robust tour construction method: **Random Insertion**. This heuristic builds a tour by starting with a small sub-tour and iteratively inserting the remaining nodes at the position that causes the minimum increase in total tour length. This method is generally less greedy and often produces a better-quality initial tour for the 2-Opt algorithm to refine. To handle the stochastic nature of this approach, I will run the entire process (Random Insertion + 2-Opt) multiple times and select the best result.

**2. Implement and Execute**
**3. Report and Compare**

The new strategy, using Random Insertion followed by 2-Opt optimization, yielded a score of 3.835058384313471. This result is slightly worse than the previous best score of 3.8154515077202653. While the Random Insertion heuristic is theoretically sound, in this specific instance, the multi-start Nearest Neighbor approach provided a better starting point for the 2-Opt refinement.

**1. Analyze and Strategize**

The best score of 3.815 was achieved by applying a 2-Opt local search to tours generated by the Nearest Neighbor (NN) heuristic, starting from every possible node. This is a strong combination, but 2-Opt can get stuck in local optima. A more powerful local search algorithm, 3-Opt, can overcome these limitations. 3-Opt considers removing three edges and reconnecting the tour in different ways, exploring a much larger solution neighborhood than 2-Opt. This increases the chances of escaping local minima and finding a better overall solution.

My strategy is to replace the 2-Opt optimization with a 3-Opt optimization, while retaining the effective approach of generating initial tours from every possible starting node using the NN heuristic.

**2. Implement and Execute**
**3. Report and Compare**

*   **New Result**: 3.890209072715248
*   **Best Previous Result**: 3.8154515077202653

The 3-Opt strategy did not improve upon the best score and, in fact, produced a worse result than the 2-Opt approach. This is counter-intuitive but can happen if the 3-Opt implementation is not exploring the neighborhood effectively or if the initial tours provided by the Nearest Neighbor heuristic lead 3-Opt into a different, poorer local minimum. Given the complexity of implementing 3-Opt correctly and efficiently, it's possible the implementation was suboptimal. The 2-Opt combination remains superior.
