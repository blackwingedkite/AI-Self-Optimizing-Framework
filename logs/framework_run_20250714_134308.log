Task Description: 
            Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
            The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
            The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
            

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.

Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.
