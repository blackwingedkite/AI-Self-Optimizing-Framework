Task Description: 
            Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
            The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
            The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
            

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.
Keep your output quite brief, concise and insightful.
Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

**Reasoning:**

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known NP-hard problem. The computational complexity arises from the factorial growth in the number of possible tours. For *n* points, there are (n-1)! / 2 unique tours. This means an exhaustive search for the optimal solution becomes computationally infeasible even for a moderate number of points (e.g., for 20 points, there are over 10^17 tours).

While exact algorithms like the Held-Karp algorithm exist, they have a time complexity of O(n² * 2ⁿ), which is exponential and only practical for very small instances. Given that finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally intractable for larger sets of points, the problem necessitates the use of heuristics.

**Proposed Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor**

A simple and effective heuristic to start with is the **Nearest Neighbor** algorithm. This is a greedy approach that builds a tour incrementally.

1.  **Initialization**: Start at an arbitrary point.
2.  **Iteration**: From the current point, find the closest unvisited point and travel to it.
3.  **Termination**: Repeat step 2 until all points have been visited.
4.  **Completion**: Return to the starting point to complete the tour.

This algorithm is computationally efficient (O(n²)) and provides a reasonably good, though not guaranteed optimal, solution quickly. It serves as an excellent baseline before exploring more complex heuristics like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms.

Based on the correct classification of this problem as requiring an indefinite or heuristic algorithm, the proposed **Nearest Neighbor** approach is implemented below. This greedy algorithm provides a fast, though not guaranteed optimal, solution.

### Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor

Here is the Python code implementing the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. It starts at the first point, iteratively travels to the closest unvisited point, and finally returns to the origin.

### Plan for Improvement

The initial score from the simple Nearest Neighbor algorithm provides a solid baseline. The following actionable steps can be taken to find a better solution:

1.  **Multi-Start Heuristic**: The quality of a Nearest Neighbor tour is highly dependent on the starting point. A simple improvement is to run the algorithm for every point as a potential start and select the shortest tour found.
2.  **Tour Optimization (2-Opt)**: Implement a local search algorithm like 2-opt. After generating the initial tour, this algorithm systematically swaps pairs of non-adjacent edges to check for improvements, effectively "uncrossing" the path until no more improvements can be found. This is very effective at refining a greedy solution.
3.  **Advanced Metaheuristics**: For potentially better solutions, implement a metaheuristic like **Simulated Annealing**. This approach can escape the local optima where a 2-opt algorithm might get stuck by occasionally accepting worse solutions, allowing it to explore a wider search space.

**Analysis and Strategy**

The previous attempt utilized a Nearest Neighbor greedy algorithm. While simple and fast, this approach often gets stuck in local optima. A superior and common local search heuristic for the Traveling Salesperson Problem is the **2-Opt** algorithm.

My strategy is to first generate an initial tour using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm and then systematically improve it using 2-Opt. The 2-Opt algorithm works by iteratively swapping pairs of non-adjacent edges in the tour to see if a shorter path can be formed. This process continues until no more beneficial swaps can be found, leading to a locally optimal solution that is generally a significant improvement over a simple greedy approach.

**Implementation and Execution**
**Report and Comparison**

The 2-Opt optimization strategy successfully improved upon the Nearest Neighbor result. By refining the initial greedy tour, the algorithm found a shorter path by eliminating edge crossings.

-   **Previous Best (Nearest Neighbor)**: 5.527293862548698
-   **New Result (2-Opt)**: 5.259467238847367

The new score represents a **4.8% improvement**, demonstrating the value of local search optimization over a simple greedy heuristic.

**1. Analyze and Strategize**

The previous iteration improved upon the Nearest Neighbor (NN) heuristic by applying a 2-Opt local search. However, the 2-Opt algorithm was initialized with a simple, sequential tour (`[0, 1, 2, ...]`). The quality of the final solution found by 2-Opt is highly dependent on its starting tour. A better initial tour can guide the search towards a more promising region of the solution space, potentially leading to a better final result.

My strategy is to combine the two previous approaches: I will first generate a reasonably good starting tour using the **Nearest Neighbor** heuristic and then use this tour as the input for the **2-Opt** optimization algorithm. This should provide a better starting point for the local search, increasing the chances of finding a superior solution.

**2. Implement and Execute**

The Python code below implements this combined NN + 2-Opt strategy. First, it constructs an initial path with the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, and then it refines this path using 2-Opt.

**3. Report and Compare**

The combined Nearest Neighbor + 2-Opt strategy yielded a score identical to the previous 2-Opt attempt. This suggests that for this specific dataset, the simple 2-Opt algorithm, even when starting from a naive sequential path, was able to find the same high-quality local optimum that the more sophisticated NN-initialized approach found. No improvement was achieved in this iteration.

**1. Analyze and Strategize**

The previous iterations have successfully implemented a Nearest Neighbor heuristic followed by a 2-Opt local search, which is a strong baseline. The score has plateaued at 5.259. This indicates the current 2-Opt algorithm is settling into a local optimum that is dependent on its starting tour. A powerful method to escape local optima and find better solutions is **Iterated Local Search (ILS)**.

My strategy is to run the 2-Opt optimization multiple times, each time starting with a different, randomly generated tour. By exploring different search trajectories from various starting points, we increase the probability of discovering a better local optimum, and potentially the global optimum.

**2. Implement and Execute**

The code will be modified to generate multiple random initial tours. The 2-Opt algorithm will be applied to each of these tours. The best tour found across all these independent runs will be recorded as the final result. I will use 100 iterations for this process.

**3. Report and Compare**

The new strategy of Iterated Local Search with 100 random starts yielded a significantly improved result.

*   **New Result**: 4.357245339927354
*   **Best Previous Result**: 5.259467238847367
*   **Improvement**: The new score is approximately 17.2% better than the previous best. This confirms that the prior solution was a local optimum and that exploring the solution space from multiple starting points is an effective enhancement.

**Your Task for This New Iteration**:
1.  **Analyze and Strategize**: Review your previous attempt(s). Propose a concrete modification to improve the result. This could be adjusting parameters, modifying the algorithm (e.g., 2-Opt to 3-Opt), or even trying a new heuristic. Justify your new strategy.
2.  **Implement and Execute**: Write and run the modified Python code reflecting your new strategy.
3.  **Report and Compare**: State the new result. Compare it to the best result from all previous attempts.

If you believe further significant improvement is unlikely, you can conclude your entire response with the single word "FINISHED".
Keep your output quite brief, concise and insightful.

Please output the scores or inference results in the last line without any other values.

**1. Analyze and Strategize**

The previous approach, a Nearest Neighbor (NN) heuristic followed by a 2-Opt local search, has reached a performance plateau. This is characteristic of deterministic local search algorithms getting trapped in a local optimum. The quality of the final solution is highly dependent on the single starting tour generated by the NN algorithm.

To overcome this, I will introduce **Simulated Annealing (SA)**, a metaheuristic designed to escape local optima. SA explores the solution space more broadly by occasionally accepting moves that worsen the current solution. The probability of accepting a worse move is controlled by a "temperature" parameter that gradually decreases over time. This allows the algorithm to make exploratory, non-greedy moves early on and transition to a fine-tuning, hill-climbing behavior as the search progresses.

My strategy is to:
1.  Generate an initial tour using the same Nearest Neighbor heuristic as before.
2.  Apply the Simulated Annealing process to this tour. The "moves" or "neighbors" will be generated using the same 2-Opt swap mechanism.
3.  Unlike the previous pure 2-Opt, a swap that increases the tour length will be accepted with a probability `exp(-delta_cost / temperature)`.
4.  The temperature will start high and cool down gradually, guiding the search from broad exploration to local exploitation.

This approach should be more robust and capable of finding a better global solution than the previous deterministic method.

**2. Implement and Execute**
**3. Report and Compare**

-   **New Result**: 4.357245339927353
-   **Best Previous Result**: 4.357245339927354

The Simulated Annealing algorithm achieved a score of 4.357245339927353, which is a marginal improvement over the previous best. The result is essentially identical, indicating that the previous 2-Opt algorithm had already found a very strong local optimum that is likely the global optimum for this dataset. The introduction of a more advanced metaheuristic confirms the quality of the existing solution. Given this, further significant improvements are highly unlikely.
