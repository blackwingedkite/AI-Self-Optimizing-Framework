Task Description: TSP

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.

Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

### Reasoning

The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of 'n' cities and returns to the origin city.

The computational complexity of this task makes finding a guaranteed optimal solution infeasible for anything beyond a small number of cities. Here's why:

1.  **Factorial Growth:** The number of possible distinct tours is `(n-1)! / 2`. This number grows extremely rapidly as the number of cities increases. A brute-force approach, which would involve checking the length of every possible tour, is computationally impossible for even a moderate number of cities.

For example, let's calculate the number of possible tours for a few different numbers of cities:
As the output shows, for 20 cities, there are over 60 quintillion possible routes. Even if a computer could check one billion routes per second, it would take millions of years to check them all.

2.  **NP-Hardness:** TSP is a well-known NP-hard problem. This means there is no known algorithm that can find the optimal solution in polynomial time (i.e., time that scales as a polynomial function of the input size, like n², n³, etc.). The best-known exact algorithms still have exponential time complexity in the worst case.

Due to this infeasibility, practical approaches for solving TSP for larger numbers of cities rely on heuristics and approximation algorithms that aim to find a good, but not necessarily perfect, solution in a reasonable amount of time.

### Proposed Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor

A simple and intuitive heuristic to start with is the **Nearest Neighbor** algorithm. It is a greedy algorithm that makes the locally optimal choice at each step.

**Algorithm Description:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start at an arbitrary city.
2.  **Iteration:** From the current city, find the nearest unvisited city and travel there.
3.  **Repetition:** Repeat step 2 until all cities have been visited.
4.  **Completion:** Return to the starting city to complete the tour.

**Example:**

Imagine 4 cities (A, B, C, D).
1.  Start at A.
2.  From A, the nearest unvisited city is C. Go to C. (Path: A -> C)
3.  From C, the nearest unvisited city is B. Go to B. (Path: A -> C -> B)
4.  The only unvisited city is D. Go to D. (Path: A -> C -> B -> D)
5.  All cities visited. Return to start (A). (Final Tour: A -> C -> B -> D -> A)

While this algorithm is fast and easy to implement, it does not guarantee the optimal solution. However, it provides a quick and reasonable baseline tour that can be used as a starting point for more advanced improvement heuristics (like 2-opt or simulated annealing).

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

Here is the data to use:
None

Now, follow these instructions:

Based on your previous analysis where you classified the problem as **Indefinite Algorithm Required**:

-   **If 'Definite Algorithm Feasible'**: Write the Python code for the exact algorithm you described. Execute it to find the optimal solution for the given data.
-   **If 'Indefinite Algorithm Required'**: Write the Python code for a first version of the heuristic algorithm you proposed. Execute the code on the given data and provide the resulting score.

After providing the code and its output, outline a brief, actionable plan for how this initial attempt could be improved in future iterations.
Please output the scores or inference results in the last line without any other values.

Based on the previous analysis classifying the problem as **Indefinite Algorithm Required**, here is the Python code for the proposed **Nearest Neighbor** heuristic.

Since no specific data was provided, a sample dataset of 10 cities with (x, y) coordinates has been created to demonstrate the algorithm's execution.

### Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor

This code implements the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. It starts at a specified city, repeatedly travels to the closest unvisited city, and finally returns to the origin after all cities have been visited.

### Plan for Future Improvement

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm provides a fast but often suboptimal solution. Here is a brief, actionable plan to improve upon this initial attempt:

1.  **Multi-Start Heuristic:** The quality of a Nearest Neighbor tour is highly dependent on the starting city.
    *   **Action:** Wrap the current algorithm in a loop that iterates through every city as a potential starting point. Run the full Nearest Neighbor algorithm for each start and keep the shortest tour found. This mitigates the risk of a poor initial choice.

2.  **Implement a Tour Improvement Heuristic (2-Opt):** The current greedy approach can create crossed paths, which are inefficient. The 2-Opt algorithm systematically removes these crossings.
    *   **Action:** After generating an initial tour (e.g., from the multi-start Nearest Neighbor), apply the 2-Opt algorithm. This involves iteratively selecting two non-adjacent edges in the tour (e.g., A-B and C-D) and checking if reconnecting them differently (A-C and B-D) results in a shorter total distance. Repeat this process until no more improvements can be found.

3.  **Explore Advanced Metaheuristics:** To find even better solutions and avoid getting stuck in local optima, more advanced algorithms can be used.
    *   **Action:** Implement a **Simulated Annealing** algorithm. It starts with the solution from the 2-Opt heuristic and introduces a probabilistic element, occasionally accepting worse moves to escape local optima. The probability of accepting a worse move decreases over time, allowing the algorithm to "cool down" and settle on a high-quality solution.
