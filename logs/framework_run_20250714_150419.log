Task Description: 
            Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
            The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
            The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
            

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.

Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

### Reasoning

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. The task is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city (or point) exactly once and returns to the origin city.

The computational complexity arises from the number of possible tours. For *n* points, the number of distinct tours is `(n-1)! / 2`. The factorial growth of the search space makes a brute-force approach, which would involve checking every possible tour, computationally intractable for even a moderate number of points.

To illustrate this rapid growth:
*   For 10 points, there are `(10-1)! / 2` = 181,440 possible tours.
*   For 15 points, there are `(15-1)! / 2` = 43,589,145,600 possible tours.
*   For 20 points, the number of tours explodes to over 6 x 10¹⁶.

Let's use a code block to calculate this for 20 points.
Because no known algorithm can find the optimal solution in polynomial time (P ≠ NP is widely assumed), we must rely on heuristics or approximation algorithms that can find a good, but not necessarily perfect, solution in a reasonable amount of time.

### Proposed Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor

A simple and effective heuristic to start with is the **Nearest Neighbor** algorithm. This is a greedy algorithm that makes the locally optimal choice at each step.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Initialization**: Start at an arbitrary point. This will be the first point in your tour.
2.  **Iteration**: From the current point, find the nearest unvisited point using the Euclidean distance.
3.  **Move**: Add the newly found nearest point to the tour and mark it as visited.
4.  **Termination**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all points have been visited.
5.  **Complete the Tour**: Return from the last visited point to the starting point to close the loop.

While this algorithm is fast (with a complexity of O(n²)), it is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution. However, it provides a good and quick approximation, making it an excellent starting point for solving the TSP.

Here is the Python code for the proposed Nearest Neighbor heuristic algorithm.

### Plan for Future Improvement

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm provides a fast but often suboptimal solution. The initial tour's quality is highly dependent on the starting point. Here is a brief, actionable plan to improve upon this first attempt:

1.  **Implement Multi-Start Heuristic**: The current algorithm always starts at the first point in the list. A simple improvement is to run the Nearest Neighbor algorithm *N* times, where *N* is the number of points, starting from each point once. We would then select the tour with the shortest overall distance. This mitigates the risk of an unlucky starting choice.

2.  **Introduce a Tour Improvement Heuristic (2-Opt)**: After generating an initial tour (using the improved multi-start Nearest Neighbor), apply a local search algorithm like **2-Opt**. The 2-Opt algorithm works by iteratively swapping pairs of edges in the tour to see if the new tour is shorter. For example, it would test breaking the tour between points (A, B) and (C, D) and reconnecting them as (A, C) and (B, D). If this swap reduces the total distance, the change is kept. This process is repeated until no more improvements can be found.

3.  **Explore Advanced Metaheuristics**: For more complex problems or higher-quality solutions, implement a metaheuristic like **Simulated Annealing**. This algorithm also starts with an initial solution and iteratively tries to improve it. However, unlike 2-Opt, it can accept "worse" solutions with a certain probability, allowing it to escape local optima and explore a wider portion of the solution space. The probability of accepting a worse move decreases over time, eventually converging on a high-quality solution.

Here is my plan for this iteration.

### 1. Analyze and Strategize

The previous best score was achieved using a Nearest Neighbor heuristic. This is a greedy algorithm that, while fast, can often lead to suboptimal tours because early choices might force long trips to unvisited nodes later on.

To improve upon this, I will implement a **2-Opt heuristic**. The 2-Opt algorithm is a local search method that takes an existing tour and systematically improves it. It works by selecting two non-adjacent edges in the tour, removing them, and reconnecting the endpoints in the only other possible way, effectively reversing the segment of the tour between the two edges. If this swap results in a shorter total tour length, the change is kept. This process is repeated until no more improvements can be found.

My strategy is to first generate an initial tour using the same Nearest Neighbor algorithm from the previous iteration and then apply the 2-Opt algorithm to refine and optimize that tour. This combination leverages the speed of the construction heuristic and the refinement power of the local search, which should produce a superior result by uncrossing paths and finding a more efficient route.

### 2. Implement and Execute

Here is the Python code that first constructs a tour using the Nearest Neighbor heuristic and then improves it with the 2-Opt algorithm.

### 3. Report and Compare

**New Result**: 3.9663441958271664

**Comparison**:
*   **Previous Best (Nearest Neighbor)**: 3.9742632490904963
*   **Current Result (2-Opt)**: 3.9663441958271664

The 2-Opt heuristic successfully improved upon the Nearest Neighbor result, reducing the total tour length. The new score is better than the best solution found so far.

Here is my plan for this new iteration.

### 1. Analyze and Strategize

The previous best score of 3.9663441958271664 was achieved by first constructing a tour using the Nearest Neighbor (NN) heuristic and then improving it with the 2-Opt algorithm. The quality of the solution found by 2-Opt can be dependent on the initial tour it starts with. The previous attempt used only one starting point for the initial NN tour.

My strategy for this iteration is to implement a **Multi-Start Nearest Neighbor with 2-Opt Optimization**. Instead of generating a single NN tour from the first point, I will generate an NN tour starting from *every* point in the dataset. Each of these 20 initial tours will then be independently optimized using the 2-Opt algorithm. The best tour among all these optimized results will be selected as the final solution.

This approach systematically explores different starting conditions, increasing the likelihood of the 2-Opt algorithm finding a better local optimum and thus a better overall solution.

### 2. Implement and Execute

Here is the Python code that implements the proposed strategy. It iterates through each point as a potential start, builds a Nearest Neighbor tour, and then applies the 2-Opt refinement. It keeps track of the best tour found across all starting points.

### 3. Report and Compare

**Best Solution Found So Far**: 3.9663441958271664

The new score of **3.7255718207117123** is a significant improvement over the previous best score of 3.9663441958271664. The strategy of using a multi-start approach for the initial tour generation, followed by 2-Opt optimization for each start, successfully found a better solution.

Here is my plan for this new iteration.

### 1. Analyze and Strategize

The previous best score of 3.7255718207117123 was achieved by generating multiple initial tours using a Nearest Neighbor heuristic (starting from each point) and then applying a 2-Opt local search to each of them. This multi-start strategy was effective because the quality of the initial tour heavily influences the final result of the local search.

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is a very fast but greedy heuristic. It can sometimes make early decisions that lead to poor overall tours. A more robust construction heuristic is the **Cheapest Insertion** algorithm.

The Cheapest Insertion algorithm works as follows:
1.  Start with a small subtour (e.g., two points).
2.  Iteratively add the remaining points.
3.  In each step, find the unvisited point that can be inserted into the current subtour with the minimum increase in total length. The cost of inserting a point `k` between two existing adjacent points `i` and `j` is calculated as `distance(i, k) + distance(k, j) - distance(i, j)`.
4.  Repeat until all points are included in the tour.

This method is less greedy than Nearest Neighbor because it considers the global impact of adding a new point on the entire existing subtour, rather than just connecting to the single closest point. My hypothesis is that a tour constructed with Cheapest Insertion will be a better starting point for the 2-Opt optimization, leading to a superior final solution.

My strategy for this iteration is to replace the multi-start Nearest Neighbor construction with a single, more powerful **Cheapest Insertion** construction, followed by the same 2-Opt refinement.

### 2. Implement and Execute
Here is the Python code implementing the Cheapest Insertion + 2-Opt strategy.### 3. Report and Compare

**New Result**: 4.13990794953449
**Best Solution Found So Far**: 3.7255718207117123

The new strategy of using a single run of Cheapest Insertion followed by 2-Opt resulted in a score of 4.1399, which is significantly worse than the best score achieved in the previous iteration (3.7255).

My hypothesis was incorrect. While Cheapest Insertion is often a superior construction heuristic in theory, for this specific problem instance, the multi-start Nearest Neighbor approach produced a better starting point for the 2-Opt algorithm. The diversity of starting multiple greedy runs and picking the best outcome proved more effective than relying on a single, more complex construction method.

**Your Task for This New Iteration**:
1.  **Analyze and Strategize**: Review your previous attempt(s). Propose a concrete modification to improve the result. This could be adjusting parameters, modifying the algorithm (e.g., 2-Opt to 3-Opt), or even trying a new heuristic. Justify your new strategy.
2.  **Implement and Execute**: Write and run the modified Python code reflecting your new strategy.
3.  **Report and Compare**: State the new result. Compare it to the best result from all previous attempts.

If you believe further significant improvement is unlikely, you can conclude your entire response with the single word "FINISHED".
Please output the scores or inference results in the last line without any other values.
