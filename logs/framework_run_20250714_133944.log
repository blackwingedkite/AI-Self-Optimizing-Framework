Task Description: 
            Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
            The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
            The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
            

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.

Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

### Reasoning

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. The task is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of points and returns to the origin.

1.  **Computational Complexity**: The number of possible tours for *n* points is `(n-1)! / 2`. The factorial function `n!` grows extremely rapidly, making a brute-force search (checking every possible tour) computationally infeasible for all but the smallest number of points. For example, for just 20 points, the number of tours is astronomically large.

    2.  **Exact vs. Heuristic Algorithms**: While exact algorithms like the Held-Karp algorithm exist, they have a time complexity of O(n² * 2ⁿ). This is still exponential and becomes impractical for more than 20-25 points. Given that the problem statement does not constrain the number of points, we must assume it could be large enough to make an exact solution infeasible. Therefore, heuristic or approximation algorithms are required to find a high-quality solution in a reasonable amount of time, even if that solution is not guaranteed to be the absolute optimal one.

### Proposed Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor

A simple and effective greedy heuristic to start with is the **Nearest Neighbor algorithm**. It's easy to implement and provides a decent initial solution.

**Algorithm Description:**

1.  **Initialization**: Start at an arbitrary point (e.g., the first point in the list). This will be the starting point of the tour.
2.  **Iteration**: From the current point, find the nearest unvisited point using the Euclidean distance.
3.  **Move**: Move to this nearest point and add it to the tour.
4.  **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all points have been visited.
5.  **Completion**: Return to the starting point to complete the tour.

While this algorithm is fast (with a complexity of O(n²)), it is considered "greedy" because it makes the locally optimal choice at each step. This does not guarantee a globally optimal solution, but it often produces a tour that is reasonably short and serves as a good starting point for more advanced optimization heuristics (like 2-opt or simulated annealing).

### Proposed Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor

A simple and effective greedy heuristic to start with is the **Nearest Neighbor algorithm**. It's easy to implement and provides a decent initial solution.

**Algorithm Description:**

1.  **Initialization**: Start at an arbitrary point (e.g., the first point in the list). This will be the starting point of the tour.
2.  **Iteration**: From the current point, find the nearest unvisited point using the Euclidean distance.
3.  **Move**: Move to this nearest point and add it to the tour.

Here is the data to use:
None

Now, follow these instructions:

Based on your previous analysis where you classified the problem as **Indefinite Algorithm Required**:

-   **If 'Definite Algorithm Feasible'**: Write the Python code for the exact algorithm you described. Execute it to find the optimal solution for the given data.
-   **If 'Indefinite Algorithm Required'**: Write the Python code for a first version of the heuristic algorithm you proposed. Execute the code on the given data and provide the resulting score.

After providing the code and its output, outline a brief, actionable plan for how this initial attempt could be improved in future iterations.
Please output the scores or inference results in the last line without any other values.

Based on the classification of the problem as **Indefinite Algorithm Required**, I will proceed with the proposed **Nearest Neighbor** heuristic.

Since no specific data was provided, I will generate a sample set of 10 random 2D points to demonstrate the algorithm's execution and output.

### Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor

Here is the Python implementation of the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The code calculates a tour for a given set of points and returns the total distance, which serves as the score.

### Plan for Future Improvement

The initial solution from the Nearest Neighbor algorithm is a good starting point, but it is rarely optimal. Here is a brief, actionable plan to improve upon this first version:

1.  **Multi-Start Nearest Neighbor**: The quality of the tour is highly dependent on the starting point. The next iteration should run the Nearest Neighbor algorithm `N` times, where `N` is the number of points, using each point as a starting location once. The shortest of these `N` tours would then be selected as the improved solution.

2.  **Implement a Tour Improvement Heuristic (2-Opt)**: After finding an initial tour (e.g., with the multi-start NN), apply a local search algorithm like **2-Opt**. The 2-Opt heuristic works by iteratively taking the current tour, removing two non-adjacent edges, and reconnecting the two resulting paths in the only other possible way. If this "swap" results in a shorter tour, the new tour is kept. This process is repeated until no more improvements can be found. This is highly effective at fixing crossed paths, which are a common source of inefficiency in greedy solutions.

3.  **Explore Advanced Metaheuristics**: For even better solutions, especially on larger datasets, the next step would be to implement a metaheuristic like **Simulated Annealing**. This algorithm also starts with an initial tour and proposes changes (like a 2-Opt swap), but it introduces a key feature: it can accept a worse solution with a certain probability. This probability decreases over time, allowing the algorithm to escape local optima early on and converge towards a high-quality global solution later.
