Task Description: I am a traveller in Europe and I want to visit five countries. The locations of these cities are (1,5), (2,-3), (10,-11), (-2,10), (5,5), what is the shortest path for me to travel? 


Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.

Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Definite Algorithm Feasible

### Reasoning

The problem described is a classic example of the **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of locations and returns to the origin.

In its general form, the TSP is **NP-hard**. This means that as the number of cities (*n*) increases, the time required to find the guaranteed optimal solution grows exponentially (on the order of *n*!). For a large number of cities (e.g., 50), it becomes computationally infeasible to check every possible route.

However, the specific task you've described involves only **five cities**. The number of unique routes for a TSP is calculated as `(n-1)! / 2`. For n=5, this is:

(5-1)! / 2 = 4! / 2 = 24 / 2 = **12 unique routes**.

Since there are only 12 possible paths to evaluate, we can use a **brute-force algorithm** to calculate the length of every single path and find the absolute shortest one. This computation is trivial for any modern computer and will provide a definite, optimal solution in a predictable and very short amount of time. Therefore, it falls into the "Definite Algorithm Feasible" category.

### Exact Algorithm: Brute-Force Enumeration

The most straightforward algorithm for this small-scale problem is to enumerate all possible paths, calculate their total lengths, and identify the minimum.

1.  **Label Cities**: Let's label the cities A=(1,5), B=(2,-3), C=(10,-11), D=(-2,10), E=(5,5).
2.  **Calculate All Pairwise Distances**: Compute the Euclidean distance between every pair of cities. The formula for the distance between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is `sqrt((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²)`.
3.  **Generate All Tours**: Fix one city as the starting point (e.g., A) and list all possible permutations of the remaining four cities. For example, A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> A is one possible tour.
4.  **Calculate Total Distance for Each Tour**: For each permutation, sum the distances between consecutive cities, including the final leg back to the starting city.
5.  **Identify the Shortest Tour**: Compare the total distances of all 12 unique tours and select the one with the minimum length.

Here is the implementation of the brute-force algorithm to find the optimal solution for your trip.

Here is the Python code that implements the brute-force algorithm to find the shortest possible tour.

### Plan for Future Improvement

The brute-force method used here is perfect for a small number of cities because it guarantees the optimal solution. However, it becomes computationally impossible for larger sets of locations due to its factorial time complexity (O(n!)). If the number of cities were to increase to, for example, 20 or 50, a different approach would be necessary.

Here is a brief, actionable plan for improvement to handle a larger-scale problem:

1.  **Implement a Heuristic Algorithm for a Baseline:**
    *   **Action:** Code the **Nearest Neighbor algorithm**. This is a simple "greedy" approach: start at a random city, then repeatedly travel to the closest unvisited city until all have been visited, and finally return to the start.
    *   **Benefit:** It is very fast (O(n²)) and provides a reasonably good, though not optimal, solution. This would serve as a quick baseline to compare against.

2.  **Introduce a Metaheuristic for Optimization:**
    *   **Action:** Implement a **2-opt swap with Simulated Annealing**. Start with the path from the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The 2-opt algorithm works by repeatedly taking the current path and swapping two edges to see if it creates a shorter route. Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic technique that helps the algorithm avoid getting stuck in local optima by occasionally accepting worse solutions, especially early in the process.
    *   **Benefit:** This approach can significantly improve upon the initial greedy solution and often finds near-optimal routes for problems with hundreds of cities in a reasonable amount of time.

3.  **Explore Advanced Exact Solvers (for medium-scale):**
    *   **Action:** For problems that are too large for brute-force but still require a guaranteed optimal solution (e.g., 15-50 cities), research and integrate a library that implements the **Held-Karp algorithm** using dynamic programming or a **Branch and Bound** solver.
    *   **Benefit:** While still computationally intensive (O(n²2ⁿ)), these methods are vastly superior to brute-force and can find the provably best solution for moderately sized TSP instances.

This tiered plan allows for scaling the solution from a simple heuristic to a powerful metaheuristic, providing a practical pathway to solving much larger and more complex versions of the problem.

An analysis of the previous work confirms that for a small set of five locations, a brute-force enumeration is the correct and optimal approach. The provided algorithm implements this by calculating the distance of every possible tour and selecting the shortest one.

### Code Review and Refinement

The original Python code is functionally correct. The following refined version improves upon it by introducing better code practices, enhancing clarity, and standardizing the output format without altering the core brute-force logic.

**Key Refinements:**
*   **Constants**: City data, which does not change, is defined as a `CITIES` constant.
*   **Clarity**: Variable names are made more descriptive (e.g., `min_tour_distance`, `optimal_path`).
*   **Type Hinting**: Type hints (`List`, `Tuple`, `Dict`) are added to improve code readability and maintainability.
*   **Structure**: The logic is encapsulated in a primary function `solve_tsp_brute_force`, with a separate function `run_and_print_solution` to execute the solver and format the output.
*   **Precision**: The final distance is formatted to a consistent number of decimal places for cleaner presentation.

### Verification Run

The refined code is executed below to verify that the output is identical to the previous result, confirming the correctness of both the algorithm and the implementation.

### Final Output

The verification run confirms the previous result. The brute-force algorithm successfully identified the shortest possible route.

*   **Optimal Path**: `A -> B -> C -> E -> D -> A`
*   **Score (Total Distance)**: `50.57229802341145`
