Task Description: 
            Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
            The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
            The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
            

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.
Keep your output quite brief, concise and insightful.
Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

**Reasoning:**
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem. The number of possible tours for *n* points is `(n-1)! / 2`. This factorial growth means that the time required to find a guaranteed optimal solution through exhaustive search becomes computationally infeasible for even a modest number of points. While dynamic programming approaches like the Held-Karp algorithm exist and can solve the problem optimally, their complexity is O(n² * 2ⁿ), which is still exponential and impractical for larger datasets. Therefore, finding an exact solution is not feasible in a predictable, polynomial amount of time, necessitating the use of heuristics for practical applications.

**Proposed Heuristic Algorithm:**
A simple and effective heuristic to start with is the **Nearest Neighbor algorithm**.

1.  **Initialization:** Start at an arbitrary point.
2.  **Iteration:** From the current point, find the nearest unvisited point using Euclidean distance.
3.  **Traversal:** Move to this nearest point and mark it as visited.
4.  **Termination:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all points have been visited.
5.  **Completion:** Return to the starting point to complete the tour.

This greedy algorithm is fast but does not guarantee an optimal solution. However, it provides a reasonable approximation quickly and serves as an excellent baseline.

Based on your previous analysis:
Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

**Reasoning:**
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem. The number of possible tours for *n* points is `(n-1)! / 2`.

Based on the provided analysis classifying the problem as requiring an indefinite algorithm, here is the Python implementation of the proposed **Nearest Neighbor heuristic**.

This code calculates the tour length by starting at the first point and iteratively moving to the closest unvisited point until all points have been visited, finally returning to the start.

### Improvement Plan

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is a greedy approach and its solution is often suboptimal. The initial tour can be significantly improved with the following steps:

1.  **Implement a 2-Opt Heuristic:** Start with the tour generated by the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. Iteratively improve it by identifying pairs of edges that cross and "un-crossing" them by swapping two edges. This local search refinement will continue until no more improvements can be found.
2.  **Try Multiple Starting Points:** Run the Nearest Neighbor algorithm starting from each of the 20 points in the dataset. Keep the best (shortest) tour found. This mitigates the risk of a poor initial choice biasing the entire solution.
3.  **Explore Metaheuristics:** For more complex problems, advance to metaheuristics like Simulated Annealing. This algorithm can accept worse solutions with a certain probability, allowing it to escape local optima that would trap a simpler 2-Opt algorithm, thereby finding a potentially better overall solution.

**Analysis and Strategy**

The previous solution used a Nearest Neighbor heuristic, which is a greedy algorithm known for being fast but often suboptimal. It constructs a path by always moving to the nearest unvisited point. This can lead to poor choices that force long-distance connections at the end of the tour.

To improve upon this, I will implement a **2-Opt heuristic**. This is a local search algorithm that starts with an existing tour (in this case, the one from our previous Nearest Neighbor attempt) and iteratively improves it. It works by selecting two non-adjacent edges in the tour, removing them, and reconnecting the endpoints in the only other possible way. If this "swap" results in a shorter total tour length, the new tour is kept. This process is repeated until no more improvements can be found. The 2-Opt algorithm is generally more powerful than simple construction heuristics and is a standard method for finding high-quality TSP solutions.

**Implementation and Execution**
**Report and Comparison**

*   **New Strategy**: Nearest Neighbor followed by 2-Opt optimization.
*   **Previous Best Score**: 4.117005541150093
*   **New Score**: 4.680981182870691

The 2-Opt algorithm, applied to the tour generated by the Nearest Neighbor heuristic, resulted in a score of 4.68098, which is worse than the previous score of 4.117. This is a surprising outcome, as 2-Opt is designed to improve a tour. This suggests a potential flaw in the initial tour generation or the 2-Opt implementation logic. I will re-evaluate the starting point and the implementation in the next iteration.

**Analysis and Strategize**

The best score of 4.117 was achieved with a simple Nearest Neighbor (NN) heuristic. The subsequent attempt, likely intended to use a 2-Opt local search for improvement, resulted in a worse score, which indicates a flawed implementation. A correctly implemented 2-Opt algorithm can only improve or maintain the score of an initial tour, never worsen it.

My strategy is to correctly implement a 2-Opt local search optimization on top of the initial tour generated by the Nearest Neighbor heuristic. This combination is a standard and effective approach for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). The NN algorithm provides a reasonably good starting solution quickly, and the 2-Opt algorithm then iteratively refines this solution by swapping pairs of edges to shorten the tour until no more improvements are possible. This should yield a result superior to the NN-only approach.

**Implement and Execute**
**Report and Compare**

The new strategy, combining a Nearest Neighbor initial tour with a 2-Opt local search refinement, resulted in a score of 4.2887922632169.

This score is worse than the best score found so far (4.117005541150093), which was achieved with the simple Nearest Neighbor heuristic alone. This is an unexpected outcome, as 2-Opt should not worsen a tour. This suggests that the initial tour from the Nearest Neighbor algorithm starting at node 0 is a local minimum that the 2-Opt algorithm used cannot escape from to find the globally better tour. The previous NN implementation might have started at a different node or had a subtle difference.
