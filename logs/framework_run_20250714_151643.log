Task Description: 
            Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
            The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
            The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
            

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.

Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

**Reasoning:**

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in computational complexity theory and is well-known to be **NP-hard**. This classification means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm that can guarantee finding the optimal solution for all instances of the problem. While exact algorithms exist (such as the Held-Karp dynamic programming algorithm or various branch-and-bound methods), their worst-case time complexity is exponential (e.g., O(n^2 * 2^n) for Held-Karp), making them computationally infeasible for even a moderate number of points (e.g., beyond 20-25 points).

The number of possible unique tours for `n` points is `(n-1)! / 2`. This factorial growth quickly leads to an astronomical number of possibilities, making brute-force enumeration impossible. For instance, with just 20 points, there are `(19)! / 2` tours, which is approximately `6 x 10^16` tours. Therefore, finding a guaranteed optimal solution in a "reasonable, predictable amount of time" (i.e., polynomial time) is not possible for general TSP instances.

**Proposed Heuristic Algorithm:**

Given that finding an exact optimal solution is computationally infeasible for larger instances, an effective heuristic algorithm is required to find a good, albeit not necessarily optimal, solution within a practical timeframe. A suitable and commonly used heuristic to start with is the **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**.

**Nearest Neighbor Algorithm Description:**

1.  **Initialization:** Choose an arbitrary starting point (e.g., the first point in the given set, or the "origin" if specified as a fixed starting point). Mark this point as visited.
2.  **Iteration:** From the current point, identify the unvisited point that is closest (minimum Euclidean distance) to it.
3.  **Movement:** Move to this closest unvisited point. Mark it as visited.
4.  **Repetition:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all points have been visited.
5.  **Completion:** Once all points have been visited, return from the last visited point to the initial starting point to complete the tour.

**Computational Complexity of Nearest Neighbor:**
The Nearest Neighbor algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the number of points. This is because for each of the N points, it potentially needs to check the distance to up to N-1 other points to find the nearest one. This makes it very efficient and practical for a large number of points.

**Advantages:**
*   **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and implement.
*   **Efficiency:** Runs in polynomial time, making it suitable for large datasets.
*   **Reasonable Solutions:** Often provides a relatively good tour, although it is a greedy algorithm and can get stuck in local optima, meaning it does not guarantee the optimal solution.

**Limitations:**
*   **Suboptimality:** The tour generated by the Nearest Neighbor algorithm is often not the shortest possible tour. The greedy choice at each step does not consider the long-term impact on the total tour length.
*   **Starting Point Dependence:** The quality of the solution can depend on the choice of the initial starting point. To mitigate this, one could run the algorithm starting from each point and choose the best resulting tour.

**Reasoning:**

Here is the data to use:
points = [[0.21889076, 0.81623802], [0.33995858, 0.30102978], [0.75518774, 0.66859397], [0.68618166, 0.1564183 ], [0.58155768, 0.60265668], [0.4352074 , 0.2711576 ], [0.72643096, 0.91977356], [0.77231064, 0.87564157], [0.22572712, 0.19620893], [0.86326664, 0.87940708], [0.56180599, 0.75322266], [0.51696452, 0.29262025], [0.61214169, 0.64335756], [0.11713432, 0.67143634], [0.01545502, 0.0224526 ], [0.47452477, 0.97596537], [0.17542458, 0.20675614], [0.37300109, 0.46348142], [0.82186417, 0.91160364], [0.1332004 , 0.77759296]]

Now, follow these instructions:

Based on your previous analysis where you classified the problem as **Indefinite Algorithm Required**:

-   **If 'Definite Algorithm Feasible'**: Write the Python code for the exact algorithm you described. Execute it to find the optimal solution for the given data.
-   **If 'Indefinite Algorithm Required'**: Write the Python code for a first version of the heuristic algorithm you proposed. Execute the code on the given data and provide the resulting score.

After providing the code and its output, outline a brief, actionable plan for how this initial attempt could be improved in future iterations.
Please output the scores or inference results in the last line without any other values.

2025-07-14 15:17:24,082 - INFO - --- [Gemini 回應] (耗時: 20.30 秒) ---
The problem has been classified as **Indefinite Algorithm Required** because the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard, meaning no known polynomial-time algorithm can guarantee an optimal solution for all instances. Therefore, a heuristic approach is necessary.

Below is the Python code for the first version of the proposed heuristic algorithm, the **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**, executed on the given data.

### Nearest Neighbor Algorithm Implementation

The resulting score (total tour length) for the Nearest Neighbor algorithm starting from the first point is **4.5951813685530345**.

### Plan for Future Improvements

This initial Nearest Neighbor algorithm provides a quick and efficient solution, but it is a greedy heuristic and does not guarantee optimality. Here's an actionable plan for future iterations to improve the solution quality:

1.  **Multiple Starting Points:** Run the Nearest Neighbor algorithm starting from *each* of the `N` points. This will generate `N` different tours. Select the tour with the minimum total length among these `N` options. This simple modification can significantly improve the solution quality without increasing the computational complexity beyond `O(N^3)` (N runs of O(N^2)).

2.  **Local Search (e.g., 2-Opt Swap):** After obtaining an initial tour (potentially from the multiple starting points approach), apply a local search heuristic like the 2-Opt swap. This involves iteratively swapping two non-adjacent edges in the tour if doing so reduces the total tour length. This process is repeated until no further improvements can be made, helping to escape local optima and find a better solution.

3.  **Explore Other Heuristics/Metaheuristics:** If higher quality solutions are still required, investigate more sophisticated metaheuristics such as:
    *   **Simulated Annealing:** A probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function.
    *   **Genetic Algorithms:** Inspired by the process of natural selection, these algorithms can explore a large solution space effectively.
    *   **Ant Colony Optimization:** Inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, this method can find good solutions to combinatorial optimization problems.

**1. Analyze and Strategize:**

The previous attempt (Iteration 2) reported a score of 0.0 and classified the problem as "Indefinite Algorithm Required" due to its NP-hard nature (Traveling Salesman Problem). This indicates that no actual TSP heuristic was implemented or run, and the score of 0.0 is a placeholder, not a calculated tour length.

My strategy for this iteration is to implement a standard heuristic approach for the Traveling Salesman Problem to obtain a concrete, calculable tour length. I will use a two-phase approach:
1.  **Initial Tour Generation**: Use the **Nearest Neighbor (NN)** algorithm to quickly generate an initial tour. This is a greedy algorithm that starts at a given point and repeatedly visits the closest unvisited point.
2.  **Tour Improvement**: Apply the **2-Opt algorithm** to the initial tour. 2-Opt is a local search heuristic that iteratively improves a tour by reversing segments of the tour if doing so reduces the total length. It continues until no further improvements can be made, reaching a local optimum.

This combination is a common and effective way to find good, though not necessarily optimal, solutions for TSP instances. This represents a significant improvement over the previous attempt, which provided no computational result.

**2. Implement and Execute:**

I will implement the `euclidean_distance`, `calculate_tour_length`, `nearest_neighbor`, and `two_opt` functions.

**3. Report and Compare:**

The new calculated tour length is **3.784723404170678**.

Comparing this to the "Best Solution Found So Far" of 0.0, this is a concrete, non-zero value representing an actual tour length. Therefore, this is a significant improvement as it provides a valid result for the problem.

**1. Analyze and Strategize:**

The previous attempt (Iteration 3) achieved a score of 3.784723404170678 using a Nearest Neighbor heuristic to generate an initial tour, followed by a 2-Opt local search optimization. The best solution found so far is 0.0, which is likely an error or placeholder as a TSP distance cannot be 0.0 for distinct points. We will compare against 3.784723404170678.

My initial thought for this iteration was to implement a 3-Opt local search, which is a common improvement over 2-Opt. However, implementing a correct and robust 3-Opt algorithm from scratch, especially handling circular list slicing and the 7 different reconnection permutations, is complex and prone to errors within the given iterative cycle constraints.

A more practical and often effective strategy for improving heuristic-based solutions, especially when the local search algorithm (like 2-Opt) is already implemented, is to employ a "Multi-start Local Search". This involves:
1.  Generating multiple different initial tours.
2.  Applying the existing local search (2-Opt) to each of these initial tours.
3.  Keeping track of the best tour found across all runs.

**Justification for New Strategy:** The 2-Opt algorithm is a local search heuristic, meaning it can get stuck in local optima. By starting the 2-Opt process from multiple different initial tours, we increase the chances of escaping a poor local optimum and finding a better one, closer to the global optimum. For the Nearest Neighbor heuristic, different starting points can lead to significantly different initial tours, thus providing varied starting points for the 2-Opt. This approach directly addresses the limitation of local search without increasing the complexity of the core optimization algorithm itself.

**2. Implement and Execute:**

I will use the `euclidean_distance`, `calculate_total_distance`, and `two_opt` functions as established in Iteration 3. The `generate_initial_tour_nearest_neighbor` function will be slightly modified to allow specifying a starting node, enabling systematic exploration. I will run the Nearest Neighbor + 2-Opt process `N` times, where `N` is the number of points, ensuring that each point serves as a starting point for the Nearest Neighbor heuristic at least once.
