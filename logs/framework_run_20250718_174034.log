You are an algorithmic expert who prefers definite, optimal strategies such as Dynamic Programming or Divide-and-Conquer.

Given the following task:

Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points. 
There are 25 points. Time complexity is quite important so you ought to consider that. 
(now is testing mode. PLEASE USE HEURISTIC MODE TO ITERATE)
        

Argue why a **definite algorithm** is more suitable for this task. Explain the benefits, provide potential algorithmic outlines, and prepare a rebuttal for typical heuristic claims.

Return your response in **pure JSON format**, with the following structure, and nothing else:
higher confidence means you are more certain about your argument
{
  "explanation": "<your explanation here>",
  "confidence": <your confidence score as a float between 0 and 1>, 
}

Do not include any markdown formatting, headings, or extra commentary. Only return the JSON object.
