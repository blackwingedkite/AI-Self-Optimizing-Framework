  "explanation": "For the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with 25 points, a definite, optimal algorithm is unequivocally the superior choice. While TSP is NP-hard, the given constraint of N=25 points places it squarely within the realm where exact solutions are computationally feasible within reasonable timeframes on modern hardware. \n\n**Benefits of a Definite Algorithm:**\n1.  **Guaranteed Optimality:** The primary and most crucial benefit is that a definite algorithm, such as Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp algorithm), guarantees finding the absolute shortest possible tour. Heuristics, by definition, only provide approximate solutions, with no guarantee on their deviation from the optimum. For critical applications, knowing the true minimum cost is paramount.\n2.  **Reproducibility and Predictability:** Given the same input, a definite algorithm will always produce the identical optimal output. This contrasts sharply with many metaheuristics (e.g., Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms) which often involve stochastic elements, leading to varying results across runs and requiring multiple executions to find a 'good' solution.\n3.  **No Tuning Required:** Exact algorithms do not require parameter tuning (e.g., cooling schedules, population sizes, mutation rates) that is often complex and problem-instance-dependent for heuristics. This simplifies implementation and deployment.\n4.  **Clear Performance Bounds:** While computationally intensive, the worst-case time complexity of exact algorithms is well-defined, allowing for precise estimation of execution time for a given N.\n\n**Algorithmic Outline (Held-Karp Dynamic Programming):**\nThis algorithm solves TSP by building up solutions for subsets of nodes.\n*   **State Definition:** `dp[mask][j]` represents the minimum cost to visit all nodes represented by the `mask` (a bitmask where the i-th bit is set if node i has been visited), ending at node `j`. We typically fix a starting node (e.g., node 0) and ensure it's always the first node visited.\n*   **Base Case:** `dp[1 << 0][0] = 0` (cost to visit only the starting node is 0).\n*   **Transitions:** Iterate through all possible masks from smallest to largest. For each `mask` and each node `j` in `mask`, iterate through all possible next nodes `k` not in `mask`. The transition would be `dp[mask | (1 << k)][k] = min(dp[mask | (1 << k)][k], dp[mask][j] + distance(j, k))`. This computes the minimum path to `k` via `j` visiting all nodes in `mask` plus `k`.\n*   **Final Result:** After computing all `dp` values, the minimum tour cost is `min(dp[(1 << N) - 1][j] + distance(j, 0))` for all `j` from 1 to N-1 (returning to the starting node 0).\n*   **Complexity:** The time complexity is O(N^2 * 2^N). For N=25, this is approximately 25^2 * 2^25 = 625 * 33,554,432 \u2248 2.09 * 10^10 operations. While a large number, this is feasible within minutes on modern CPUs (e.g., 5-10 seconds), making it a viable and optimal solution for N=25.\n\n**Rebuttal for Typical Heuristic Claims:**\n*   **Claim: \"Heuristics are faster.\"**\n    *   **Rebuttal:** For N=25, the speed advantage of heuristics is often marginal or non-existent when considering the time required to find a truly *good* heuristic solution (which often involves multiple runs or complex local search). More importantly, any speed gain comes at the cost of optimality. If the task demands the best possible solution, a few minutes for an optimal answer is preferable to seconds for an unknown-quality approximation.\n*   **Claim: \"Heuristics provide 'good enough' solutions.\"**\n    *   **Rebuttal:** \"Good enough\" is subjective and not guaranteed. In real-world scenarios, even a small percentage deviation from the optimal tour can translate to significant financial losses (e.g., fuel costs, driver wages, delivery times). The problem statement implies a requirement for *the* solution, not merely an adequate one. For N=25, the optimal solution is within reach, so settling for 'good enough' is unnecessary.\n*   **Claim: \"Heuristics are easier to implement.\"**\n    *   **Rebuttal:** While simple heuristics like Nearest Neighbor are easy, sophisticated metaheuristics (e.g., Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization, Tabu Search) are often complex to implement correctly, requiring intricate data structures, careful parameter selection, and often integrating local search components. The Held-Karp algorithm, while conceptually challenging, is a well-defined and deterministic procedure without the need for empirical tuning."

You are Agent A. You have made the following argument:
For the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with 25 points, a definite, optimal algorithm is unequivocally the superior choice. While TSP is NP-hard, the given constraint of N=25 points places it squarely within the realm where exact solutions are computationally feasible within reasonable timeframes on modern hardware. 

**Benefits of a Definite Algorithm:**
1.  **Guaranteed Optimality:** The primary and most crucial benefit is that a definite algorithm, such as Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp algorithm), guarantees finding the absolute shortest possible tour. Heuristics, by definition, only provide approximate solutions, with no guarantee on their deviation from the optimum. For critical applications, knowing the true minimum cost is paramount.
2.  **Reproducibility and Predictability:** Given the same input, a definite algorithm will always produce the identical optimal output. This contrasts sharply with many metaheuristics (e.g., Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms) which often involve stochastic elements, leading to varying results across runs and requiring multiple executions to find a 'good' solution.
3.  **No Tuning Required:** Exact algorithms do not require parameter tuning (e.g., cooling schedules, population sizes, mutation rates) that is often complex and problem-instance-dependent for heuristics. This simplifies implementation and deployment.
4.  **Clear Performance Bounds:** While computationally intensive, the worst-case time complexity of exact algorithms is well-defined, allowing for precise estimation of execution time for a given N.

**Algorithmic Outline (Held-Karp Dynamic Programming):**
This algorithm solves TSP by building up solutions for subsets of nodes.
*   **State Definition:** `dp[mask][j]` represents the minimum cost to visit all nodes represented by the `mask` (a bitmask where the i-th bit is set if node i has been visited), ending at node `j`. We typically fix a starting node (e.g., node 0) and ensure it's always the first node visited.
*   **Base Case:** `dp[1 << 0][0] = 0` (cost to visit only the starting node is 0).
*   **Transitions:** Iterate through all possible masks from smallest to largest. For each `mask` and each node `j` in `mask`, iterate through all possible next nodes `k` not in `mask`. The transition would be `dp[mask | (1 << k)][k] = min(dp[mask | (1 << k)][k], dp[mask][j] + distance(j, k))`. This computes the minimum path to `k` via `j` visiting all nodes in `mask` plus `k`.
*   **Final Result:** After computing all `dp` values, the minimum tour cost is `min(dp[(1 << N) - 1][j] + distance(j, 0))` for all `j` from 1 to N-1 (returning to the starting node 0).
*   **Complexity:** The time complexity is O(N^2 * 2^N). For N=25, this is approximately 25^2 * 2^25 = 625 * 33,554,432 ≈ 2.09 * 10^10 operations. While a large number, this is feasible within minutes on modern CPUs (e.g., 5-10 seconds), making it a viable and optimal solution for N=25.

**Rebuttal for Typical Heuristic Claims:**
*   **Claim: "Heuristics are faster."**
    *   **Rebuttal:** For N=25, the speed advantage of heuristics is often marginal or non-existent when considering the time required to find a truly *good* heuristic solution (which often involves multiple runs or complex local search). More importantly, any speed gain comes at the cost of optimality. If the task demands the best possible solution, a few minutes for an optimal answer is preferable to seconds for an unknown-quality approximation.
*   **Claim: "Heuristics provide 'good enough' solutions."**
    *   **Rebuttal:** "Good enough" is subjective and not guaranteed. In real-world scenarios, even a small percentage deviation from the optimal tour can translate to significant financial losses (e.g., fuel costs, driver wages, delivery times). The problem statement implies a requirement for *the* solution, not merely an adequate one. For N=25, the optimal solution is within reach, so settling for 'good enough' is unnecessary.
*   **Claim: "Heuristics are easier to implement."**
    *   **Rebuttal:** While simple heuristics like Nearest Neighbor are easy, sophisticated metaheuristics (e.g., Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization, Tabu Search) are often complex to implement correctly, requiring intricate data structures, careful parameter selection, and often integrating local search components. The Held-Karp algorithm, while conceptually challenging, is a well-defined and deterministic procedure without the need for empirical tuning.

0.0

For solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with 25 points, a heuristic algorithm is significantly more suitable than an exact (definite) algorithm, primarily due to the inherent NP-hard nature of TSP and the explicit emphasis on time complexity. 

**Scalability**: While 25 points might seem manageable, the time complexity of exact algorithms like brute-force (O(N!)) or dynamic programming (Held-Karp, O(N^2 * 2^N)) grows exponentially.

This 'good enough, fast enough' characteristic is crucial in real-time systems or applications requiring frequent problem solving. They are also less sensitive to minor data perturbations.

**Countering Critiques**:

Heuristics can deliver solutions in milliseconds.

While TSP is NP-hard, the given constraint of N=25 points places it squarely within the realm where exact solutions are computationally feasible within reasonable timeframes on modern hardware. 

**Benefits of a Definite Algorithm:**
1.  **Guaranteed Optimality:** The primary and most crucial benefit is that a definite algorithm, such as Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp algorithm), guarantees finding the absolute shortest possible tour. Heuristics, by definition, only provide approximate solutions, with no guarantee on their deviation from the optimum. For critical applications, knowing the true minimum cost is paramount.
2.  **Reproducibility and Predictability:** Given the same input, a definite algorithm will always produce the identical optimal output. This contrasts sharply with many metaheuristics (e.g., Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms) which often involve stochastic elements, leading to varying results across runs and requiring multiple executions to find a 'good' solution.
3.  **No Tuning Required:** Exact algorithms do not require parameter tuning (e.g., cooling schedules, population sizes, mutation rates) that is often complex and problem-instance-dependent for heuristics. This simplifies implementation and deployment.
4.  **Clear Performance Bounds:** While computationally intensive, the worst-case time complexity of exact algorithms is well-defined, allowing for precise estimation of execution time for a given N.

**Algorithmic Outline (Held-Karp Dynamic Programming):**
This algorithm solves TSP by building up solutions for subsets of nodes.
*   **State Definition:** `dp[mask][j]` represents the minimum cost to visit all nodes represented by the `mask` (a bitmask where the i-th bit is set if node i has been visited), ending at node `j`. We typically fix a starting node (e.g., node 0) and ensure it's always the first node visited.
*   **Base Case:** `dp[1 << 0][0] = 0` (cost to visit only the starting node is 0).
*   **Transitions:** Iterate through all possible masks from smallest to largest. For each `mask` and each node `j` in `mask`, iterate through all possible next nodes `k` not in `mask`. The transition would be `dp[mask | (1 << k)][k] = min(dp[mask | (1 << k)][k], dp[mask][j] + distance(j, k))`. This computes the minimum path to `k` via `j` visiting all nodes in `mask` plus `k`.
*   **Final Result:** After computing all `dp` values, the minimum tour cost is `min(dp[(1 << N) - 1][j] + distance(j, 0))` for all `j` from 1 to N-1 (returning to the starting node 0).
*   **Complexity:** The time complexity is O(N^2 * 2^N). For N=25, this is approximately 25^2 * 2^25 = 625 * 33,554,432 ≈ 2.09 * 10^10 operations. While a large number, this is feasible within minutes on modern CPUs (e.g., 5-10 seconds), making it a viable and optimal solution for N=25.

**Rebuttal for Typical Heuristic Claims:**
*   **Claim: "Heuristics are faster."**
    *   **Rebuttal:** For N=25, the speed advantage of heuristics is often marginal or non-existent when considering the time required to find a truly *good* heuristic solution (which often involves multiple runs or complex local search). More importantly, any speed gain comes at the cost of optimality. If the task demands the best possible solution, a few minutes for an optimal answer is preferable to seconds for an unknown-quality approximation.
*   **Claim: "Heuristics provide 'good enough' solutions."**
    *   **Rebuttal:** "Good enough" is subjective and not guaranteed. In real-world scenarios, even a small percentage deviation from the optimal tour can translate to significant financial losses (e.g., fuel costs, driver wages, delivery times). The problem statement implies a requirement for *the* solution, not merely an adequate one. For N=25, the optimal solution is within reach, so settling for 'good enough' is unnecessary.
*   **Claim: "Heuristics are easier to implement."**
    *   **Rebuttal:** While simple heuristics like Nearest Neighbor are easy, sophisticated metaheuristics (e.g., Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization, Tabu Search) are often complex to implement correctly, requiring intricate data structures, careful parameter selection, and often integrating local search components. The Held-Karp algorithm, while conceptually challenging, is a well-defined and deterministic procedure without the need for empirical tuning.

And here is the confidence of your argument:
0.0

Here is the argument made by Agent B:
For solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with 25 points, a heuristic algorithm is significantly more suitable than an exact (definite) algorithm, primarily due to the inherent NP-hard nature of TSP and the explicit emphasis on time complexity. 

**Scalability**: While 25 points might seem manageable, the time complexity of exact algorithms like brute-force (O(N!)) or dynamic programming (Held-Karp, O(N^2 * 2^N)) grows exponentially. For N=25, Held-Karp involves roughly 2 * 10^10 operations, pushing the limits of practical computation for a single solve, and becoming intractable for even slightly larger instances (e.g., N=30 would be 32 times slower). Heuristic algorithms (e.g., Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization, or even simpler local search methods like 2-opt/3-opt) typically have polynomial time complexities per iteration (e.g., O(N^2) or O(N^3)). This allows them to find high-quality solutions very quickly (milliseconds to seconds) even for N=25, and gracefully scale to much larger problem sizes where exact methods are completely infeasible.

**Flexibility**: Heuristic approaches offer superior flexibility. They can be easily adapted to incorporate real-world constraints that are common in practical TSP variations, such as time windows, vehicle capacities, multiple depots, or specific node visit orders. Adding such constraints to an exact algorithm often dramatically increases its complexity or renders it unsolvable. Heuristics can also be modified to optimize different objective functions (e.g., minimizing fuel consumption, balancing workload) with relative ease, by simply changing the fitness or cost function.

**Robustness**: Heuristics are robust in finding very good, near-optimal solutions. While they do not guarantee global optimality, for NP-hard problems, the computational cost of achieving absolute optimality often far outweighs the marginal benefit over a high-quality heuristic solution. For 25 points, a well-tuned heuristic can reliably achieve solutions within 1-2% of the optimal path in a fraction of the time an exact method would take. This 'good enough, fast enough' characteristic is crucial in real-time systems or applications requiring frequent problem solving. They are also less sensitive to minor data perturbations.

**Countering Critiques**:
*   **'25 points is small enough for exact solutions'**: While technically possible with Held-Karp on a powerful machine, the 'time complexity is quite important' directive suggests that even seconds might be too long. Heuristics can deliver solutions in milliseconds. Furthermore, this argument ignores future growth; if the problem size increases slightly, exact methods become unusable, whereas heuristics continue to provide viable solutions.
*   **'Heuristics don't guarantee optimality'**: This is true, but for NP-hard problems, the pursuit of guaranteed optimality often leads to computational paralysis. In practical scenarios, the trade-off between solution quality and computation time heavily favors heuristics. The marginal improvement from a guaranteed optimal solution over a very good heuristic solution is often not worth the exponential increase in computation time.

You are an impartial judge reviewing a debate between two algorithm experts regarding the best strategy for solving the following task:

Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points. 
        There are 25 points. Time complexity is quite important so you ought to consider that. :)
        

Agent A's critique of B:
Agent B's argument introduces valid considerations, particularly regarding the flexibility of heuristics for real-world TSP variants with additional constraints (e.g., time windows, capacities). This is indeed a strength of heuristic approaches. However, the problem as stated is for the standard Traveling Salesman Problem with 25 points, not a complex variant. For this specific problem, the core benefits of a definite algorithm remain paramount.

Agent B's claim that N=25 'pushes the limits of practical computation' and that 'seconds might be too long' is an overstatement for modern hardware. As outlined, 2.09 * 10^10 operations, while large, translates to a timeframe of 5-10 seconds on contemporary CPUs, which is well within a 'reasonable timeframe' for obtaining a guaranteed optimal solution, especially for critical applications where precision is key. The 'explicit emphasis on time complexity' does not automatically imply a need for millisecond-level solutions at the expense of optimality, particularly when the optimal solution is demonstrably achievable in mere seconds.

The argument about scalability to N=30 or larger is also a valid point for future-proofing or different problem sizes, but it does not diminish the fact that for the *given N=25*, an optimal solution is within reach. Settling for a 'good enough' heuristic solution, even if within 1-2% of optimal, carries inherent risks of unquantified deviation and potential significant real-world costs, which are entirely avoidable when optimality is feasible. The trade-off of a few seconds for absolute certainty is a worthwhile one.

Agent B's critique of A:
While Agent A makes a strong case for the technical feasibility of Held-Karp for N=25, their argument overlooks crucial practical considerations directly implied by the 'time complexity is quite important' directive. Agent A's estimate of 5-10 seconds, while achievable, is still orders of magnitude slower than the milliseconds attainable by well-tuned heuristic algorithms. For applications requiring frequent problem solving or real-time responses, this difference is paramount, rendering exact methods impractical despite their theoretical feasibility. Agent A completely fails to address the superior flexibility of heuristic approaches in incorporating real-world constraints (like time windows, capacities, or multiple depots), which are common in practical TSP variations and would dramatically increase the complexity or even render exact algorithms unsolvable. Furthermore, while guaranteed optimality is a theoretical advantage, Agent A does not adequately quantify the marginal benefit of absolute optimality over a near-optimal solution (e.g., within 1-2% deviation) for N=25, especially when weighed against the exponential increase in computation time. The 'good enough, fast enough' principle is critical for NP-hard problems. Agent A's focus solely on N=25 also ignores the inherent lack of scalability of exact methods; even a slight increase to N=30 makes Held-Karp intractable, whereas heuristics gracefully scale. Finally, while metaheuristics can be complex to tune, simpler local search heuristics are straightforward to implement and provide excellent performance for N=25, often outperforming exact methods in practical speed for a 'good' solution, without the memory overhead of a 2^N DP table.

Final confidence scores:

"Definite" describes something that is clear, certain, and precise, leaving no room for doubt or ambiguity. It implies a fixed, established, or specific quality, contrasting with anything vague or uncertain. For instance, a "definite answer" provides a conclusive response, a "definite plan" has clear steps, and a "definite article" like "the" points to a specific noun. In essence, if something is definite, it's well-defined, sure, and leaves no room for misinterpretation.

This is iteration 6. Your task is to improve upon previous results.


You are an algorithmic optimization expert using a **definite strategy**.

Your task is to offer and refine an  exact algorithm for the following problem:

Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points. 
        There are 25 points. Time complexity is quite important so you ought to consider that. :)
        

With the final strategy:
definite and As an impartial judge, I find that both Agent A and Agent B present compelling arguments, highlighting the inherent trade-offs in solving NP-hard problems. Agent A's strength lies in directly addressing the problem as stated: a standard Traveling Salesman Problem with N=25 points. For this specific problem size, an exact algorithm like Held-Karp (Dynamic Programming) is indeed computationally feasible on modern hardware. Agent A's estimate of 5-10 seconds for a guaranteed optimal solution is realistic and, for many applications, falls well within a 'reasonable timeframe,' especially when precision is paramount. The ability to obtain the absolute best solution without any deviation risk is a significant advantage that heuristics cannot offer.

Agent B, however, raises crucial practical considerations that are often implied by the phrase 'time complexity is quite important,' even if not explicitly detailed in the problem statement. Their points about the 'orders of magnitude' difference in speed for real-time applications, the superior flexibility of heuristics for incorporating real-world constraints (which are common in practical TSP scenarios), and the inherent lack of scalability of exact methods beyond N=25 are highly valid. The memory overhead of Held-Karp (O(N*2^N)), which for N=25 is approximately 6.7 GB, is also a practical constraint that Agent A did not fully address.

However, the problem explicitly states 'standard Traveling Salesman Problem' and N=25. It does not mention real-time constraints, frequent re-computation, or future scalability to N=30+. While Agent B's arguments are strong for the general applicability of TSP solutions or for more complex variants, they somewhat deviate from the specific, constrained problem presented. For N=25, the 'optimal solution is demonstrably achievable in mere seconds,' making the trade-off of a few seconds for absolute certainty a worthwhile one if the primary goal is optimality for *this specific instance*.

Given the precise problem definition (standard TSP, 25 points, 'time complexity is quite important' but not 'real-time' or 'millisecond'), the ability to achieve guaranteed optimality within a manageable timeframe (5-10 seconds) outweighs the potential speed benefits of heuristics for this particular problem instance. While heuristics are excellent for larger N or constrained variants, for N=25, the optimal solution is within reach..

Then, implement the algorithm in Python code.

You previously attempted this solution:

It produced:

```python

Result Score: None

Your Responsibilities:

* Review & Reflect: If it is the first iteration, please give the code and execute it. Is the algorithm optimal and final? If not, how can it be improved?
* Enhance & Explain: Refactor or restructure it, improve clarity and efficiency (but preserve correctness).
* Verify: Run the new version and compare it with the previous result. Is the result identical, or improved?

You may stop refining if:

* You believe this is the best possible solution.
* You detect diminishing returns.
**OUR GOAL IS TO FIND THE BEST SOLUTION, NOT JUST A METHOD WHICH IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.**
Return your response in **pure JSON format**, with the following structure:

{
"explanation": "<Your brief critique and justification of the changes.>",
"value": \<Result score of the new version, as a float>,

--- [Iteration 7 的完整 Prompt] ---
This is iteration 7. Your task is to improve upon previous results.


You are an algorithmic optimization expert using a **definite strategy**.

Your task is to offer and refine an  exact algorithm for the following problem:

Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points. 
        There are 25 points. Time complexity is quite important so you ought to consider that. :)
        

With the final strategy:
definite and As an impartial judge, I find that both Agent A and Agent B present compelling arguments, highlighting the inherent trade-offs in solving NP-hard problems. Agent A's strength lies in directly addressing the problem as stated: a standard Traveling Salesman Problem with N=25 points. For this specific problem size, an exact algorithm like Held-Karp (Dynamic Programming) is indeed computationally feasible on modern hardware. Agent A's estimate of 5-10 seconds for a guaranteed optimal solution is realistic and, for many applications, falls well within a 'reasonable timeframe,' especially when precision is paramount. The ability to obtain the absolute best solution without any deviation risk is a significant advantage that heuristics cannot offer.

Agent B, however, raises crucial practical considerations that are often implied by the phrase 'time complexity is quite important,' even if not explicitly detailed in the problem statement. Their points about the 'orders of magnitude' difference in speed for real-time applications, the superior flexibility of heuristics for incorporating real-world constraints (which are common in practical TSP scenarios), and the inherent lack of scalability of exact methods beyond N=25 are highly valid. The memory overhead of Held-Karp (O(N*2^N)), which for N=25 is approximately 6.7 GB, is also a practical constraint that Agent A did not fully address.

However, the problem explicitly states 'standard Traveling Salesman Problem' and N=25. It does not mention real-time constraints, frequent re-computation, or future scalability to N=30+. While Agent B's arguments are strong for the general applicability of TSP solutions or for more complex variants, they somewhat deviate from the specific, constrained problem presented. For N=25, the 'optimal solution is demonstrably achievable in mere seconds,' making the trade-off of a few seconds for absolute certainty a worthwhile one if the primary goal is optimality for *this specific instance*.

Given the precise problem definition (standard TSP, 25 points, 'time complexity is quite important' but not 'real-time' or 'millisecond'), the ability to achieve guaranteed optimality within a manageable timeframe (5-10 seconds) outweighs the potential speed benefits of heuristics for this particular problem instance. While heuristics are excellent for larger N or constrained variants, for N=25, the optimal solution is within reach..

Then, implement the algorithm in Python code.

You previously attempted this solution:
```python
ERROR: No code provided.
````

It produced:

```python
ERROR: No output provided.
```

Result Score: 0.95

Your Responsibilities:

* Review & Reflect: If it is the first iteration, please give the code and execute it. Is the algorithm optimal and final? If not, how can it be improved?
* Enhance & Explain: Refactor or restructure it, improve clarity and efficiency (but preserve correctness).
* Verify: Run the new version and compare it with the previous result. Is the result identical, or improved?

You may stop refining if:

* You believe this is the best possible solution.
* You detect diminishing returns.
**OUR GOAL IS TO FIND THE BEST SOLUTION, NOT JUST A METHOD WHICH IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.**
Return your response in **pure JSON format**, with the following structure:

{
"explanation": "<Your brief critique and justification of the changes.>",
"value": \<Result score of the new version, as a float>,
"is\_finished": \<true or false, depending on whether you consider further refinement unnecessary>
}

⚠️ Do not include markdown blocks, code blocks, or any commentary outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.
