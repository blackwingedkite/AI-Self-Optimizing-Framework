Task Description: 
        Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
        The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
        The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
        

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.

Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

### Reasoning

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem. This classification stems from its computational complexity.

1.  **Combinatorial Explosion**: The number of possible tours for *n* points is `(n-1)! / 2`. The factorial function grows extremely rapidly, making a brute-force approach of checking every possible tour computationally infeasible for all but the smallest number of points. For instance, for just 20 points, there are over 1.2 x 10¹⁷ possible tours, a number that would take modern computers billions of years to evaluate.

2.  **No Known Polynomial-Time Algorithm**: There is no known algorithm that can find the guaranteed optimal solution for the TSP in polynomial time (i.e., with a complexity of O(n^k) for some constant k). The most efficient exact algorithms, such as the Held-Karp algorithm using dynamic programming, have a time complexity of **O(n² * 2ⁿ)**. While much better than the factorial complexity of brute-force, this exponential growth still renders the problem intractable for larger instances (e.g., n > 30).

Because finding a guaranteed optimal solution cannot be done in a reasonable or predictable amount of time for most practical scenarios, the problem requires the use of heuristics or approximation algorithms. These methods aim to find a high-quality solution that is "good enough" in a feasible amount of time, sacrificing the guarantee of optimality for speed.

### Proposed Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor

A simple yet effective heuristic to start with for the Traveling Salesman Problem is the **Nearest Neighbor** algorithm. It is a greedy algorithm that is easy to implement and provides a reasonable, albeit often suboptimal, solution quickly.

#### Algorithm Description:

The algorithm builds a tour by iteratively selecting the closest unvisited point to the current point.

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   Select an arbitrary point as the starting point.
    *   Initialize the tour with this point.

2.  **Iteration**:
    *   From the current point, find the nearest point that has not yet been visited. The distance is calculated using the Euclidean formula: `d = sqrt((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)`.
    *   Add this nearest point to the tour.
    *   Set this new point as the current point.
    *   Repeat this step until all points have been visited.

3.  **Completion**:
    *   Once all points are in the tour, create a final edge from the last point visited back to the original starting point to complete the cycle.

#### Example Walkthrough:

Let's find a tour for four points: A(0,0), B(1,5), C(3,1), D(6,4).

1.  **Start at A(0,0)**. Tour: `[A]`
2.  **Current point: A(0,0)**.
    *   Distance to B(1,5): `sqrt(1² + 5²) ≈ 5.10`
    *   Distance to C(3,1): `sqrt(3² + 1²) ≈ 3.16`
    *   Distance to D(6,4): `sqrt(6² + 4²) ≈ 7.21`
    *   The nearest is **C**. Add C to the tour. Tour: `[A, C]`
3.  **Current point: C(3,1)**. Unvisited points are B and D.
    *   Distance to B(1,5): `sqrt((1-3)² + (5-1)²) = sqrt((-2)² + 4²) = sqrt(20) ≈ 4.47`
    *   Distance to D(6,4): `sqrt((6-3)² + (4-1)²) = sqrt(3² + 3²) = sqrt(18) ≈ 4.24`
    *   The nearest is **D**. Add D to the tour. Tour: `[A, C, D]`
4.  **Current point: D(6,4)**. Only B is unvisited.
    *   Add **B** to the tour. Tour: `[A, C, D, B]`
5.  **Completion**: All points visited. Return to the start.
    *   Final Tour: **A -> C -> D -> B -> A**

This algorithm has a time complexity of **O(n²)**, making it very fast and a good starting point for finding an initial solution, which can then be further improved by more advanced heuristics like 2-Opt or Simulated Annealing.

Here is the data to use:
points = [[0.97513508, 0.52622181], [0.7584708 , 0.16978591], [0.27417421, 0.39124385], [0.51129741, 0.65081954], [0.14646468, 0.42506684], [0.57040504, 0.77936627], [0.92425743, 0.75641497], [0.34554365, 0.65166694], [0.91675344, 0.4818543 ], [0.51280112, 0.22595478], [0.55499238, 0.58003845], [0.14537642, 0.25891797], [0.34123074, 0.78690932], [0.83002563, 0.52128442], [0.16099499, 0.92810773], [0.00290492, 0.06470566], [0.13200084, 0.71326592], [0.68800366, 0.52823778], [0.91304862, 0.4199627 ], [0.81919797, 0.17280153]]

Now, follow these instructions:

Based on your previous analysis where you classified the problem as **Indefinite Algorithm Required**:

-   **If 'Definite Algorithm Feasible'**: Write the Python code for the exact algorithm you described. Execute it to find the optimal solution for the given data.
-   **If 'Indefinite Algorithm Required'**: Write the Python code for a first version of the heuristic algorithm you proposed. Execute the code on the given data and provide the resulting score.

After providing the code and its output, outline a brief, actionable plan for how this initial attempt could be improved in future iterations.
Please output the scores or inference results in the last line without any other values.

` block.
The code will contain:
- The `points` data.
- A `calculate_distance` function.
- A `nearest_neighbor` function that takes the points as input.
- The main execution block that calls `nearest_neighbor` and prints the results.

The `nearest_neighbor` function logic:
- `num_points = len(points)`
- `unvisited = set(range(num_points))`
- `start_node = 0`
- `current_node = start_node`
- `tour = [current_node]`
- `total_distance = 0.0`
- `unvisited.remove(current_node)`
- Loop while `unvisited` is not empty:
    - `nearest_dist = float('inf')`
    - `next_node = None`
    - Loop through each `candidate_node` in `unvisited`:
        - `dist = calculate_distance(points[current_node], points[candidate_node])`
        - if `dist < nearest_dist`:
            - `nearest_dist = dist`
            - `next_node = candidate_node`
    - `total_distance += nearest_dist`
    - `current_node = next_node`
    - `tour.append(current_node)`
    - `unvisited.remove(current_node)`
- Add distance back to start: `total_distance += calculate_distance(points[current_node], points[start_node])`
- Return `tour` and `total_distance`.

This seems correct and follows the algorithm described. I will now write the full code.Based on the classification of this problem as requiring an indefinite algorithm, I will implement the proposed **Nearest Neighbor heuristic**. This algorithm provides a fast, approximate solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem.

### Heuristic Algorithm Implementation: Nearest Neighbor

Here is the Python code for the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, which iteratively builds a tour by always moving to the closest unvisited point.
