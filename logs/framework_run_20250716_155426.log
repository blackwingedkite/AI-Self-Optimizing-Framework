        The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
        The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.

You are an algorithmic expert who prefers definite, optimal strategies such as Dynamic Programming or Divide-and-Conquer.

Given the following task:


        Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
        The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
        The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
        

Argue why a **definite algorithm** is more suitable for this task. Explain the benefits, provide potential algorithmic outlines, and prepare a rebuttal for typical heuristic claims.

Rate your confidence in your position from 0 to 1, formatted as:
Confidence: [0~1]
