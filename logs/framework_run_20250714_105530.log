Task Description: 
    Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
    The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
    The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
    

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.

Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

### Reasoning

**1. Computational Complexity Analysis:**

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in computer science and is well-established as being **NP-hard**. This classification stems from its computational complexity.

*   **Brute-Force Approach:** The most straightforward way to find the shortest tour is to check every possible permutation of the points. For a set of *n* points, the number of distinct tours is `(n-1)! / 2`. The factorial function `n!` grows extremely rapidly, making this approach computationally infeasible for all but the smallest number of points. For instance, for 20 points, the number of tours to check is over 1.2 x 10^18.
*   **Exact Algorithms:** More sophisticated exact algorithms exist, such as the Held-Karp algorithm, which uses dynamic programming. However, its time complexity is **O(n² * 2ⁿ)**. While much better than the factorial complexity of the brute-force method, this exponential growth still renders it impractical for larger sets of points (typically becoming infeasible beyond 20-25 points).

Since there is no known algorithm that can solve the TSP to optimality in polynomial time, finding a guaranteed optimal solution for an arbitrary number of points is considered computationally infeasible. This places the problem firmly in the **Indefinite Algorithm Required** category, necessitating the use of heuristics or approximation algorithms to find good, but not necessarily perfect, solutions in a reasonable amount of time.

### Proposed Heuristic Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor

For problems requiring a heuristic approach, a good starting point is an algorithm that is simple to implement, fast to run, and provides a reasonable solution. The **Nearest Neighbor** algorithm fits this description perfectly. It is a "greedy" algorithm that makes the locally optimal choice at each step.

**Algorithm Description:**

1.  **Initialization**: Start at an arbitrary point and add it to the tour.
2.  **Iteration**: From the current point, find the closest unvisited point using the Euclidean distance.
3.  **Move**: Move to this nearest point, add it to the tour, and mark it as visited.
4.  **Termination**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all points have been visited.
5.  **Complete the Tour**: Return to the starting point to close the loop.

**Example Implementation:**

Here is a Python implementation of the Nearest Neighbor heuristic for a given set of 2D points.

While this heuristic is fast, it's important to note that it is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution. The choice of the starting point can significantly affect the quality of the resulting tour. A common enhancement is to run the algorithm multiple times, each with a different starting point, and select the best tour found.
