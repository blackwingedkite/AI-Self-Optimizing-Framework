Task Description: 
            Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 2D points.
            The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each point exactly once and returns to the origin point.
            The distance between points is the Euclidean distance.
            

Analyze the computational complexity of the described task. Based on your analysis, classify the problem into one of two categories:
1.  **Definite Algorithm Feasible (DP-like)**: A category for problems where an exact, optimal solution can be found in a reasonable, predictable amount of time (e.g., polynomial time).
2.  **Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)**: A category for problems where finding a guaranteed optimal solution is computationally infeasible, thus requiring heuristic or approximation strategies.
Keep your output quite brief, concise and insightful.
Start your response with the classification in the format: "Classification: [Your Classification]".

Then, provide your reasoning. If you classify it as 'Definite Algorithm Feasible', describe a suitable exact algorithm. If you classify it as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', propose an effective heuristic algorithm to start with.

Classification: Indefinite Algorithm Required (Heuristic/NP-Hard)

**Reasoning:**
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. Finding the shortest possible tour that visits each of `N` points exactly once and returns to the origin point involves evaluating a vast number of possible routes. The number of distinct Hamiltonian cycles in a complete graph with `N` vertices is `(N-1)! / 2`. This factorial growth rate makes exhaustive search computationally infeasible for even a moderate number of points. TSP is a well-known NP-hard problem, meaning there is no known polynomial-time algorithm that can guarantee an optimal solution for all instances.

**Proposed Heuristic Algorithm:**
A simple and effective heuristic for TSP is the **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**.
1.  Start at a designated origin point.
2.  From the current point, find the unvisited point that is closest (minimum Euclidean distance).
3.  Move to that closest point and mark it as visited.
4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all points have been visited.
5.  Finally, return from the last visited point to the origin point.

This algorithm is computationally efficient (O(N^2)) and provides a quick, approximate solution, though it does not guarantee optimality.

Given the classification as 'Indefinite Algorithm Required', I will implement the Nearest Neighbor heuristic.

**Score:** 5.763915544900062

**Future Improvement Plan:**
This initial attempt uses a greedy approach. Future iterations could improve the solution by:
1.  **Multiple Starts:** Run the Nearest Neighbor algorithm starting from each possible point and choose the best resulting tour.
2.  **2-Opt Swap:** Implement a local search heuristic like 2-Opt, which iteratively removes two edges and reconnects them in a different way if it reduces the total tour length. This can significantly improve the quality of the initial Nearest Neighbor tour.
3.  **Other Heuristics:** Explore more sophisticated heuristics such as Christofides algorithm (for metric TSP), Ant Colony Optimization, or Genetic Algorithms, which often yield better approximations.

**Analysis and Strategy:**
The previous iteration utilized the Nearest Neighbor heuristic, which is a greedy approach for generating an initial tour. While efficient, it often produces suboptimal results for Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) variants. To improve upon this, a common and effective strategy is to apply a local search optimization algorithm. The 2-Opt algorithm is a widely used local search method for TSP that iteratively improves a tour by swapping two non-adjacent edges if the swap leads to a shorter tour. This can significantly reduce the tour length found by a greedy heuristic.

My strategy for this iteration is to:
1.  Generate an initial tour using the Nearest Neighbor heuristic (as in the previous iteration).
2.  Apply the 2-Opt local search algorithm to the initial tour until no further improvements can be made.
3.  Calculate the total length of the optimized tour.

**Implementation and Execution:**
I will first define the Euclidean distance function and the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. Then, I will implement the 2-Opt algorithm to refine the tour.

**Report and Compare:**
The new result after applying the 2-Opt local search algorithm to the Nearest Neighbor tour is 4.630775131606935.

Comparing this to the best result from all previous attempts (5.763915544900062), the 2-Opt optimization has yielded a significant improvement.
